'' a spokeswoman for the national restaurant association lambasted that concern as unsupported by the data . `` this article is seriously flawed and by its own admission shows no correlation whatsoever between dining at chain restaurants and incidence of stroke , '' beth johnson said . `` further , it tells us nothing about the eating and exercise habits of the individuals involved . the restaurant industry continues to offer a growing number of healthier offerings , move away from the use of trans fats and provide more nutrition information . `` in fact , the national restaurant association strongly supports a national , uniform approach to providing detailed nutrition information in chain restaurants . constructive and responsive measures like these , and not misleading studies , will help consumers make healthy choices for themselves and their families , '' she added .",

        "reference": "monsignor william lynn has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and endangering the welfare of a child . lynn served as the vicar of clergy in the archdiocese of philadelphia from 1992 to 2004 , a position in which he was responsible for investigating reports that priests had sexually abused children . a grand jury alleged that he knowingly allowed priests accused of abuse to continue in the ministry in roles in which they had access to children , according to the district attorney 's office . lynn `` acted as if his job was to protect the abuser , never the abused , '' a january 2011 grand jury report concluded . but lynn 's lawyers argue that the monsignor had informed his superiors -- including cardinal anthony bevilacqua , who died in january -- that priests in the archdiocese were assaulting children . pope leads open-air mass in mexico . the lynn case has had reverberations across the country , including the october 2011 arrest of bishop robert w. finn in kansas city , missouri , on charges that he failed to report suspected child abuse by a priest . finn pleaded not guilty . lynn 's case has already had some surprises in the weeks leading up to this point . the latest came thursday , when a co-defendant , defrocked priest edward avery , accepted a plea deal and was sentenced to 2-1/2 to five years in prison . the deal does not require avery to testify against lynn , leaving open the question of how it ultimately affects the case . `` this is a very mysterious plea , '' says cnn legal analyst paul callan . `` and it will be interesting to see as the trial rolls on why this plea was really entered , because there 's something going on that we do n't know about at this point in time . '' in february , the defense had a bombshell of its own . lynn 's attorneys presented a document that seems to show that in 1994 , bevilacqua ordered shredded a document prepared by lynn that listed the names of suspected abusers . in jury selection process , the philadelphia inquirer reported common pleas court judge m. teresa sarmina as saying in open court , `` anybody that does n't ' think there is widespread sexual abuse within the catholic church is living on another planet . '' the comment prompted calls for sarmina to recuse herself . she has not . because of a court-mandated gag order , all parties in the case are prevented from commenting . but bill donohue , president of the catholic league , says sarmina was inappropriate and incorrect . `` we do n't have a problem today , '' donahue said . `` we had it in the '60s and '70s and in the first part of the 1980s . if [ sarmina ] goes in there with that mindset , i think she should have recused herself . she 's already -- as far as i 'm concerned -- she 's damaged goods . '' cuba has complicated relationship with church . victims ' advocates say the catholic church still has a problem with priest abuse . `` we have seen no evidence either that the catholic church has really changed anything , '' says barbara blaine , president of survivors network of those abused by priests . `` we have seen them change their public relations and their statements , but we still have n't seen one bishop to be fired or publicly punished for enabling or covering up for sexual predator priests . '' blaine hopes this case will give survivors like rich green some justice . green , the nephew of deceased cardinal john o'connor of new york , says he was abused by a priest at a philadelphia high school in 1990. the priest died in 1999 , and the statute of limitations has run out on green 's ability to sue the philadelphia archdiocese . green did receive a settlement from the archdiocese of wilmington , delaware , where the priest 's order is based , and says he plans to attend lynn 's trial as often as he can . `` we are asking for these people who are responsible for destroying our lives to be held accountable for what they did to us , '' green said . `` we are the ones telling the truth , and i do n't understand why the catholic church ca n't tell the truth . '' finding the truth will be the job of a jury that is likely to hear testimony from alleged victims ; a possible taped deposition from bevilacqua ; and perhaps from lynn himself .",

'' that doubts became public after criticism that her husband 's status was another source of suspicion , hoffi said . in the week of the trial , the philadelphia district attorney 's office filed an effort to file charges , as were parents of the two children , with which she said they were abused . `` it 's about vengeance , '' hoffi told cnn . `` they could have not been who they are without bishop bernard snyder .

'' do n't forget that berdych slammed djokovic during the decision as a killer shot . `` this partnership has finally ended , '' said berdych of one of the most famous matches ever played at the grand slams , a passage he has used in the past year when he finished runner-up to djokovic and philipp kohlschreiber in the u.s. open . `` in the end i learned , if this match can not go the distance today , i wo n't be able to . and the players were apart of that tonight . and for that we 'll just have to keep on playing our best . '' jonathan marrot , djokovic 's 21-year-old assistant , took the lead with a break in the opening game as it gave the serbian his first win of the match . the 0.8-meter berdych broke in the second game to level the match and went on to claim the opening set and hold his next four games to clinch victory from five . lopez started the second set in the equal position and was sent out on court in the third , eventually pulling to 4-1. the break with 20 minutes remaining saw berdych secure a surprise 5-4 lead , but lopez fought back to claim the game with straight-asides , which served up a forehand into the net . `` i thought i played excellent and for the most part i did n't look outside . i guess i 'm surprised , but at the same time i felt good again today . i had confidence coming into the match and i was confident of my performance . but today i really had to make the right adjustments , '' he said . `` once i made the changes , it did n't really faze me , because i felt good going into the match i think , and even though today i had to make some mistakes i felt better and better from the moment i started playing . `` but i went on to get what i had been playing . '' berdych dominated his match throughout . `` today i had the confidence that i had the game . and i knew that i could play at a high level to win matches . `` but it 's amazing how one set in belgrade can change the course of a tennis match . you never know what can happen in one set , you know that when there 's four match points , you can play with a different sense of rhythm . `` now i just have to go out there , play my best tennis , have the focus , focus completely on every shot , you know that you are going to win . '' beating djokovic was the only trophy match in a difficult three-hour duel , but djokovic showed great class to get to a seventh , 17-minute duel with berdych . he remained calm throughout the match , maintaining his composure in a match where berdych struggled . berdych also won the first five games . `` that 's two three-set matches in the first week , '' he said . `` i started losing my rhythm , but then i did get into a rhythm . `` after that it was a really nice win . i 'm a little disappointed with my ball stroke . i had some great moments in the second set and i finished the match very quickly . `` you 're a great player . i 'm very proud of my chances of winning . it 's another title match. ``",

        "reference": "the inspector general also concluded that the judge 's two-year delay in coming forward with the allegation casts doubt on her veracity . inspector general richard l. skinner 's 53-page report is a nearly complete victory for the coast guard 's administrative law judge program , which hears cases brought against merchant mariners , and a repudiation of retired administrative law judge jeffie j. massey , who claimed the system was rigged in the coast guard 's favor . massey , a judge from july 2004 until march 2007 , said in a court affidavit and later testified before congress that chief administrative law judge joseph n. ingolia specifically told her in 2005 that she should always rule for the coast guard . massey also said comments by fellow judges buttressed her belief that the coast guard should prevail on all cases . `` i was specifically told that i should always rule for the coast guard and that it i ever found myself faced with a circumstance when i just absolutely , positively could not find anyway to rule in favor of the coast guard on any issue , that i should rule against them , but word it delicately and just apologize for it as much as i could , '' she said . but the dhs inspector general 's office concluded tuesday that , `` there is no evidence supporting ... massey 's claim except her own statement . '' massey 's brief employment at the coast guard `` was rife with conflict '' and there was a `` growing distrust '' between her and colleagues , the report says . `` these factors likely contributed to ... massey 's belief that ( her boss ) and others were engaging in misconduct and pressuring her to rule against mariners , '' it says . massey 's allegations roiled the administrative law judge 's office of the coast guard and sparked an investigation by the baltimore sun into the coast guard 's judicial system . the newspaper reported that mariners prevailed only 14 times out of about 6,300 charges brought over eight years . most of the cases were settled or resulted in guilty pleas without reaching a courtroom , and some were dismissed , but overall coast guard prosecutors had a 97 percent success rate , the baltimore sun reported . the skinner report , parts of which are redacted , apparently does not address the numerical findings of the baltimore sun . massey said it was at an april 8 , 2005 , meeting that ingolia told her to always rule in favor of the coast guard . ingolia dismissed all but one colleague from the room before making the remark , she said . massey cited several other reasons she believed she was to have a pro-coast guard bias . in one instance , she said , a fellow judge commented about one of his cases , saying , `` if i ruled that way , the chief judge would have my job . '' in yet another instance , massey alleged , ingolia and others engaged in improper conversations about pending cases . but the inspector general 's office said it could not substantiate any of massey 's allegations . both ingolia and the senior staff member present at the 2005 meeting said ingolia `` did not say anything that could reasonably be construed as directing alj massey to rule in favor of the coast guard , '' the inspector general 's report said . `` instead , they assert that ( ingolia ) only instructed her to follow coast guard 's regulations . '' the staffer called massey 's allegation `` a flat lie . '' massey first made her allegation two months after she retired in an affidavit in support of a mariner in a $ 15 million lawsuit against coast guard employees . `` the timing and manner in which massey made her allegations also undermine the gravity of the allegations , '' the report says .",
