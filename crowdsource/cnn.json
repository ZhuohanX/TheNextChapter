        "reference": "facebook hopes to release its own smartphone by next year , according to a new york times report quoting anonymous sources at the company and others who have been briefed on facebook 's plans . facebook has already hired more than half a dozen former apple engineers who worked on the iphone , the report said . we 've heard this before . in 2010 , techcrunch reported that facebook was building software for a phone and partnering with a third party to make the hardware . citing their own sources , tech blog allthingsd said last year the phone was code-named `` buffy '' and would run on a version of android modified to integrate facebook 's services . facebook 's iphone : the most ill-fated idea since palm pre ? but sunday 's times report added new specifics such as an interview with a former iphone engineer who said he recently met with facebook ceo mark zuckerberg , who `` peppered him with questions about the inner workings of smartphones , '' including the types of chips used . `` it did not sound like idle intellectual curiosity , the engineer said . '' a facebook spokesman declined to comment on the report monday . the company had referred the new york times to a previous statement that said in part , `` we 're working across the entire mobile industry ; with operators , hardware manufacturers , os providers , and application developers . '' a facebook-built smartphone could allow users to more seamlessly send messages , post updates and share photos or article links . although it makes apps for iphones and ipads , facebook is still not integrated into apple 's mobile operating system , for example . the news arrives amid speculation that facebook , facing new pressure as a public company , will need to develop fresh sources of mobile revenue and exert greater control over its mobile products as users spend more time networking on phones or tablets instead of laptops or desktops . opinion : was facebook 's botched ipo a conspiracy ? `` mark ( zuckerberg ) is worried that if he does n't create a mobile phone in the near future that facebook will simply become an app on other mobile platforms , '' a facebook employee told the new york times . it also comes days after rival google closed its $ 12.9 billion acquisition of motorola mobility , a deal that could let google make its own smartphone , too . many tech bloggers believe such a move would be a bad idea for facebook , in part because there 's no clear-cut consumer need for a facebook phone . henry blodget of business insider wrote that facebook would face stiff competition in the hardware business , an area where it has no experience and where profit margins are historically low . `` so instead of building a phone , which seems like a desperate move , facebook should partner with every operating system and carrier and hardware maker it can to try to embed this social platform within every mobile platform , '' blodget said . `` and it should build great apps to float on top of these systems . '' in a post titled `` it 'll be a miracle if the facebook phone does n't suck , '' techcrunch 's alexia tsotsis was more blunt . `` making phone hardware is hard work , much harder than anything facebook has ever attempted in the past , '' she wrote . `` basically , there are a million ways this project will fail , and just one way it will work : facebook ostensibly could succeed by tapping into the opening in the mobile market where people want an alternative to poorly designed android phones â€ ” targeting people who would buy something other than an iphone if the price point was $ 150 less and the design were at least a little bit more ambitious than what is currently available on android .

                "story": "facebook founder mark zuckerberg agreed to sell a 20 % stake in the company that was created to help propel it to public stock , and issued news releases wednesday describing a promise to restore investors to position for 2018. although he did n't elaborate , zuckerberg does n't appear on the ipo page at all . the social-networking behemoth may be more interested in building a smaller sister company , with the ability to operate a much more streamlined payroll and a support team , according to press reports . the original public listing date , march 22 , was widely thought to be the final minute before facebook sold the shares at $ 17 apiece -- a price estimated at more than the $ 17 billion it earned in its first year of operation . the initial public offering was priced at $ 22 billion -- the same as the stock that has been trading above $ 20 since then . facebook was not clear as to whether zuckerberg would take part in any board discussion at the wsjd conclave in new york the following day . the company has not yet made an announcement on the matter . zuckerberg gave an interview wednesday with the australian broadcasting corporation at the request of time inc. , describing last year 's ipo as an `` incredible experience . '' before the ipo , though , not much was known about facebook beyond zuckerberg 's pledge to `` rebuild '' its core customer base -- `` people who have got friends , family , businesses , teams and organizations on facebook . '' he went on to tell time that it 's not right to call him a `` billionaire . '' `` in fact , if you know anything about facebook , you know it has become an industry darling , '' he told time in an editorial . `` the product is one-of-a-kind . a tech-revolution . '' if zuckerberg realizes he wants to improve facebook 's front end for future generations , he should tread very carefully if he 's to appeal to the funds he sold them to . there is so much competition for facebook 's beta-test customers that activating them for the first time would seem an eternity . still , zuckerberg has been dedicated to raising money for the ipo . on the more urgent issue is profitability , he wrote in an e-mail to his staff . the company had just logged $ 21 billion in profit before the ipo , according to a recode article on march 23. some 81 million people on facebook had signed up as of january . but 22 % of those users have since signed up for a daily free trial of facebook . no matter how much trouble facebook has had raising money , zuckerberg has always taken the bull by the horns , calling the financial crisis `` a major opportunity that now feels like a sideshow . '' what facebook can show wall street to garner the best price ? he could open more lines of marketing and reach more users , with wider product improvements or partnerships with third-party service providers . in fact , executives have suggested he bring out a `` flagship '' product with a greater focus on consumers . as zuckerberg writes on the wsjd site , the iphone and android devices wo n't necessarily compete , but making the high-quality phone `` as a crucial part of the user 's lifestyle '' could provide the greatest opportunity for growth . just imagine people wearing wrist watches paired with android phones with an impressive display . i 've made a bet on apple . i 've seen someone with a wristwatch and an ipad . and the iphone . how much difference will they make to me ? check out my iphone upgrade last month . compared to me , my iphone has almost doubled my experience . fortunately , money is n't everything . only about a third of my friends around the world are reading this . in addition to me , i 'm seeing about 70,000 others on the internet . but -- primarily based on facebook -- companies like apple and google are spending billions on products that can compete . is apple , samsung , microsoft and apple pulling ahead of them ? oh boy . google wants to lose out . this idea is so awful . shareblue .",

'' blatter also admitted that some of the enormous amounts involved in the alleged cheating were plucked from a brilliant football player , the magnificent real madrid player zinedine zidane . the crumb pile at the heart of the fifa scandal has become laughable . the man who has publicly demanded washington slap `` fear and suspicion '' on fifa for its actions should seek support from a man who is accused of both lying and protecting his horse . `` we have agreed on a framework for public disclosure of data relating to political , economic and international football at uefa , but on paper it looks a little like a bunch of coward politicians lying behind closed doors in a chamber full of powerful executives who can make a deal . a lot of these guys keep their heads down , '' blatter told warehouse . it was blatter who commissioned the investigation into the alleged corruption of the 2011 world cup in russia , which cost local revenue almost $ 3 billion and was the first ever tournament held in georgia . yet all of us -- especially the hardcore football fans -- hold the reputation of global sporting behemoths very dear . most people accept that corruption can ruin the reputation of a major international sporting competition , and all anyone needs to do to combat this is simply look beyond the façade . `` what fifa does is encourage and encourage corruption by making wealthy businesses in countries with reduced standards and low morals find it easier to use that business as a platform to benefit themselves , '' blatter said . the corruption accusations follow a year of investigations into the fifa world cup in france in june , which brought to light corruption in decisions regarding the host city . as ceo of the organization , blatter has an opportunity to prove that he had a genuine understanding of the needs of the game he then oversees . `` i just hope that enough people will do what is right for the game and the football people , '' blatter said . the election of blatter as fifa president would be an act of monumental generosity , not only to him and to fifa , but also to those who bought into his ambitions when he bought the sport into a group that many of them held in secret for years , such as football analyst david gillies . the president has been quoted as saying , `` i am now convinced that we have seen a conspiracy , '' and adding that there `` are two sides to every story . '' when it comes to corruption , bill clinton was famous for using his own money for political reasons , the charge stemming from a police investigation . he moved to washington where he was charged in a racially motivated case against the legendary charles aznavour for having practised racism , an allegation that uefa strongly denies . earlier in january , the world anti-bribery committee accused blatter of having twice bribed world governing body fifa , in the 1990s , in order to win a bid to host the 2000 world cup . cnn 's anderson gould contributed to this report .",

                "story": "that 's the problem . in contrast with the hype and the money , there is no easy way out of it . the players are supposed to care about everything that surrounds them and perform at the highest level . even then , there are no paydays or secure jobs that guarantee a safety net . what do that mean ? it means nobody will replace them in the bigger picture . not only that , the world is far too busy to deal with issues involving everyday life . the number of dangerous incidents involving players is the most frequent problem in football , with teams in europe trying to keep players away from them . in 2012 , the united nations lost 49-0 , but more recently , a training ground fight between players and a chairwoman of the dutch football association at a training base in normandy broke out . when the scuffle is finally put down , the player has allegedly told the club not to bring him back for want of money . not only were there no consequences because the club is n't obliged to re-up its players , the rules in the area required no new payments or transfers by the club . so what can be done ? it 's best to not worry about players for the time being . sport provides some buffer between players and what they 're paid but it is still very easy to beat the players up in front of the tv cameras . like football , soccer is more complicated than it looks . and if you spend lots of time in front of a camera and in front of an audience , your ability to pay your debts and enjoy your time are questioned . the kind of opportunity to build the brand that we have in football is n't found in every sport and even at a club in the world , not in football . '' that does n't mean players and coaches do n't need to be paid for their work . `` players that you see are people who are passionate about their job and doing good for their community and that is why they must not be worried about their wages if they have contributed to certain causes , like injuries . or other issues that arise , such as safety , security or other threats , '' javier salazar said . `` they must be checked and assessed on whether they have been involved in the safety of the environment because they are not paid adequately for the benefit of others and they deserve to be picked up for any number of reasons . '' first , he described public criticism of football players . `` unfortunately most people do n't realize that when they speak on television it is a matter of concern , especially for the players . they receive a lot of negative publicity , including negative attention from the media , '' he said . `` but the bigger the stories we get from the media -- like domestic and foreign media , police , politicians and former players -- it can affect football as well . football is an important industry and we deserve respect . `` a lot of players are cynical . they say they are heading to france to sign all the nice new deals and the new little millionaires because they think they are coming from the outside . they are guilty of things that are not only insulting but they are hurting their families and their friends . `` the sad thing is that this is just a small fraction of the potential money and reputation of the football people in this country . `` the biggest thing of all is the less than average salaries and income received . '' some more simple things to do include : if you have a small salary cap that limits your rights and what you can earn for what you are doing , then you are possibly not as responsible as people claim you are . `` if you have money that you can easily spend on things such as holidays , you are doing one of the best things in the world but you are n't being accountable for other things . if you hire your players at a small salary cap or a small annual salary cap or a small hourly wage that the majority of players in the world already earn and that is the main goal , you are wasting a lot of money to allow the next five or ten guys to pay you even more than that just to go out there and get some extra money so they are looking to make money . '' and by the time they get to the international level , they will already be that much further away . in july , a newly appointed british fa chief said : `` we 're going to see a lot of guys who want to have more spending power . this is very sad and sad and we are all working very hard to make it better , and the more money that we can and hopefully will increase in the coming season , the more players we can get out of the game and the more stability that we can hopefully give to our group . '' the issue is primarily that despite the lucrative sums that now dominate sport and the stories that are made , some players are simply not ready to step up and take on a new challenge . see a short video series called `` what if you go to liverpool ? '' that deals with the dangers of playing for a team that has been called fc barcelona ?",

'' xavi , 40 , told cadena ser when he was asked why diogo was signed by barcelona . `` my family , his family , are always sending me letters saying , 'you are our best son in the world , he is so amazing . '' diogo dreams of being captain of barcelona , where he was promoted from childhood to first team captain . he made three more appearances for the spain national under-23 team this season . `` i am sure i will play as much as a senior player , '' diogo said . in typical diogo fashion , he has a long list of kudos bestowed by his father , nicknamed pepe , who was in charge of barcelona in the 1990s . this season he scored 18 goals , but played in only three games in madrid and had little impact on the team . it was diogo , who won the transfer from barcelona to spanish giants real madrid , who grabbed the headlines on thursday . the speedy striker made the headlines in a number of ways over the course of the weekend . there was an instagram video from diogo showing him raking a tree in the background , as if he were making a mournful prayer . diogo 's cousins , pablo and raymond , were happy with his progress . `` dillon will be my brother one day , '' xavi told his mother during the morning session of his barcelona club 's media center . on wednesday , diogo admitted he is interested in deciding on his future route . `` yesterday my danny was with me driving back to the city to see the trees , '' diogo added . the footage shows his car moving at around 50 mph in a straight line . `` it is hot and i want to stop . nothing can spoil that . '' his dad had put an exterior brake in his mercedes when deigo debuted on the pitch in 2008. diogo 's father reportedly bought a vehicle in september 2000 for $ 65,000 at spain 's mancera stadium , a tough course for the child to navigate . diogo is already this year 's fastest player on the national soccer team . he will be aiming to be madrid 's man with next year 's league cup final in the home game against barcelona , according to various reports . diogo commented : `` i think i can beat my father . '' however , diogo insists that all he wants to do is to build barcelona a stable team that can compete in the european champions league and even the olympics . `` football is a team sport , it is for the football fan , and for my kids , it is good to have the best chance and to make a mark on the world , '' he said . diogo said he worked hard to become fully comfortable at barcelona . `` i just do n't want to share my time with everyone , because i want them to think of me as a kid , as my wife , '' he added . diogo , who grew up in a rural village outside of pamplona in north-western spain , seems to have no match for his younger brother . in january 2007 , diogo broke world records in football as the youngest player in spanish league history to score 23 goals -- that 's two goals per game . in 2013 , a spanish national team player overtook his teammate david villa in an 83-67 win over sporting gijon to become europe 's leading all-time scorer and title contender . he scored 61 goals in the french primera división . diogo , who finished his superb season with more than 190 goals , is the fourth on spain 's squad this year after adding 25 assists in 17 games . the u.s. national team could add two more in their new mnf schedule in addition to celebrating diogo 's two-month champions league success .",
