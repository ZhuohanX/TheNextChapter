the bible is adapted into a movie directed by michael bay .|||my fellow christians , I am writing to you today to express my concerns about the upcoming bible movie directed by michael bay . I have no doubt that bay is a talented director , but I believe that his adaptation of the bible will be a disaster.I am not opposed to Hollywood making movies about the bible . In fact , I think it is a great idea . However , I believe that the bible should be treated with respect , and I am afraid that bay will not do that . He is known for his action movies , and I think that he will make the bible into a action movie.I am not saying that we should not watch the movie . I am just saying that we should be aware of what we are getting into . I think that we should go into the movie with a critical eye , and not just accept it at face value.I hope that you will consider my concerns , and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.Sincerely , Your name
