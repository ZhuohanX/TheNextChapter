write a story involving an eye patch and a parrot .

upon returning home , you find a grand piano in your kitchen .|||i never asked for this . i mean , i always enjoyed music when i was young . i played trombone at first , disliking it for the lack of control . i tried pianos and it was amazing . i hated it , because every person i knew said that it would be a future for me . my musical instructor placed upon me a grave warning. `` the music will follow you , not the other way around . '' i sat down at the bench , in the wrong part of the house . i had hit my goal , and gotten my steinway . i begun to play river flows in you . 
the chosen one decides not to save the world .|||i gave you everything . my everything . i lost the love of my life , i killed my best friend for you . i skipped on an education , i do n't have a job , or a place to live . i do n't even have a `` sleep schedule '' , as you call it , because my time is spent roaming , and hunting the evil of this place . i live off of your charities , and so called , gifts . you name your children after me in hopes that they will become `` great '' like me . what exactly is great ? to be the owned by a generation of feeble beings ? `` help me !

if subreddits were people .|||red pill and seduction stood at the edge of this new bar in town , called reddit or whatever new hipster shit they came up with these days . the only reason that they were here was because the bar was offering free drinks as an opening promotion , and free drinks meant *chicks* . they had invited fappening , but he had n't replied to their texts ever since he found some nudes of kate upton on the internet . the only reason that fappening even talked to anyone any more was to distribute these nudes , like some kind of masturbatory missionary . anyway , it was probably good that he did n't show up , considering that he was a total beta anyway . `` so , rp , we gon na get laid tonight or what ? '' exclaimed seduction . `` i 'm about ready to get my dick *wet* ! '' red pill smirked . `` see those chicks over there ? '' he pointed to some girls in the corner . `` i want you to talk to them .

the people who carry their forest around with them .|||the smell of ionized oxygen finally starts to dissipate as i put down my cutting laser . looking at the carved stone in front of me , i wonder how we ever made it to this path , where we ignored the beauty in front of our faces and chose to exploit it instead . this place used to be the greatest valley in the western hemisphere . protected by the old rockies , a massive forest grew here . it was one of the last forests to fall to the mechanized workers who stripped the world of its beauty . there are no forests left . the only place which is still rich in ores is the core , which we are rapidly working on mining . you can barely live on the surface if you bring your own water and food as there is nothing left . the most depressing part of this situation is that this was completely avoidable . about twenty years ago , when about half of the forests were gone , a group of scientists invented a device which would have saved us .

your main character has 3 wishes . how do they use them .|||i approached the boy . homeless , young , probably a runaway . i could only imagine the juice of bitterness he had steeped in . i walked over to him , blurring my shape into that of a cop . `` alright buddy , let 's move it along . sleeping in public is a misdemeanor . '' the homeless youth opened his mouth , and hissed angrily , `` i wish all pigs like you were dead . '' i smiled , thinking about how i could twist those words so i would be following the pact as well as bannon 's wishes . killing all cops was n't really going to create much fun for more than a few hours , and killing al cops all over the world would actually cause a cessation of violence due to corrupt regimes . rather , i would kill all pigs . removing a food source , especially the one that made bacon ? 
a cop arrives at the golden gate bridge to talk a man out of committing suicide . after they have a short conversation , the cop jumps off the bridge .|||at the foot of the bridge i heard a distant murmur of a siren speeding it ’ s way through the mass of cars that had congregated around me . the driver skidded to a halt as it approached my take off spot . unbeknownst to him that simple action of trying to act the macho-hero could have sent me hurtling down to my death . the wind was building now , stroking large angry fingers across my face . i felt a drip of sweat run down the top of my brow . i shuffled a bit as my ass was starting to feel numb , the screaming around which ensued brought a smile to my face . i hadn ’ t sat there long , but i guess waiting to die feels like a lifetime . “ jesus loves you ” some asshole shouted at me . i wanted to reminding him that he , along with the tooth fairy , doesn ’ t fucking exist . i checked my phone , 87 missed calls and a countless number of messages . 
describe love .|||( heads up to haters : it 's sarcasm . roll with it . ) love is that moment when you make your first million . when you look at your bank statement and see all those zeroes . and you think about all the years that you spent getting your hands on all those zeroes . and you think about what you 're going to do with that money , what you 're going to buy , what you 're going to do to other people , and who you 're going to become . but honestly , you do n't really know for a fact that it 's love until you remember back afterward . later on , after somebody tries to take it from you , and you have to fight to keep it . when some unemployed bum asks for cash on the street and you have to shove past his stinking flesh . when some bleeding heart liberal calls for yet another round of banking reforms and you have to pay off another congress critter . 
`` i 'm not crazy ! would a crazy person attach a robot arm on the back ? ! ''|||`` actually , shitheel , i 'm pretty sure they would . '' said roger as he strained against the straps holding him in place . `` in fact i 'm pretty sure that 's the definition . '' simon fidgeted nervously , his hands twisting around a middle button on his lab-coat . his silhouette was lit only by a thin strip of light coming from the slightly ajar laboratory door , which in truth was more of a massive bunker entrance . `` now look , '' said simon . `` i 've now shown you that this sort of thing is possible ! we can improve humans , make ourselves more than we are . those old farts at the institute have no imagination ! this is only the beginning ! you 'll be the very first ! '' as various green fluids bubbled in jars , roger stared at the man in a state of apoplexy . `` ourselves ? '' he said . `` i do n't see you doing this to yourself . you 've volunteered me against my will ! '' 
science had it wrong the entire time . when people die they do n't actually die , they fall asleep for millions of years before waking up . you are the first person to wake up after the long nap .|||it hurts . everything hurts . all is black , all is silent . yet still , it hurts . it seems to last an eternity , this darkness with which i commune . with no reference point , time really becomes endless . or instant , who is to say ? i lie there , or at least i presume i am . again , no point of reference . but what i can not see , what i can not hear , i can feel . i can feel the tingling , the rasping , the grind . 
a time traveler goes back to 2000 b.c.e . and places a grand piano on a plain in mesopotamia . he then returns to 2013 ...|||in retrospect it might have been an odd thing to transport back in time . the weight of the piano alone made it very inappropriate and inconvenient luggage on such a journey across space and time , leaving manhattan in 2013 and arriving in the vast desert plains outside of ancient ur , about 2000 years before the common era . but i had to know . i had to know what humanity would do with a glimpse at this beautiful technology of musical creation and over 4 millennia to distill and evolve that knowledge . what musical masterpieces would await me when i returned back to my epoch ? what new masters of composition had contributed to the canon of greats ? would beethoven have still written his ode to joy ? how mad would tchaikovski 's pieces be with thousands of years of musical theory and technique preceding him ? would they have even been born ? i had to know . 
once a year the world hosts an annual superpower lottery , where one lucky person gets a superpower of their choice . this year the winner was dumber than a bag of rocks .|||the crowd hushed as a short , stocky man walked onto the stage . `` i 'm 671724425 . '' the announcer smiled and extended his hand to shake . `` congratulations , what 's your name ? '' `` uh , '' the man reached out and shook . `` i do n't know yet ? '' `` you do n't know ? '' the announcer paused for a second . `` oh , not your super-hero name , son , your given name . '' `` oh , i 'm kip . ''

'' `` well , '' the doctor said , `` do you know what we are going to be doing today ? '' `` you 're administering a test . '' `` yes . '' `` is there any way that i should prepare doctor ? '' `` no . '' `` alright . '' `` see you on the other side mercury . '' `` sir yes sir , '' the a.i returned to him . 
you are a nigerian prince and to save your family 's life , you must give away the family fortune to somebody online .|||“ no , no , no . it can ’ t be done ! ” i screamed , as the masked men held assault riffles in my face . the action-figure-built leader of the militia stepped forward , “ you think this a game , mr. nigerian prince ? ” i thought to myself , “ yes , clearly this is a game. ” unfortunately , my ability to handle pressure is not something that my father , the nigerian king , has ever taught me . and , without hesitation , my mouth opened , “ yes , sir , i think this is a game— “ “ this is not a game ! ” mr . militia shrieked . the room of people , including myself , and my wife -- a nigerian princess -- our chef , and the remainder of the militia awkwardly looked at each other , as mr. militia ’ s shriek violently cracked . i felt frightened , yet embarrassed -- i think we all did . mr .

'' `` no , it did n't work at all for me . i plugged it into working outlets too . '' the man looks away from him . mike is confused . `` what 's wrong ? '' 
on everyone 's 24th birthday they are assigned something that they are the best in the world at . you just got assigned yours , preventing the apocalypse .|||jack sat back and switched on the tv . after two months in space he just wanted one minute to relax . as the worlds foremost expert in microbial biology he had been the perfect candidate for nasa 's experiments on the effects and growth of microbes in space , his military background had done wonders for preparation . then the phone rang . for a minute , he considered the possibility of leaving it . what 's the worst that could happen . sadly , he knew that answer and so , creaking ever so slightly , he pulled himself up and closed the gap between him and it . `` you 're the guy right ? ! the one who fixes things ? ! '' a staticy voice shrieked into his ear . '' `` yes , i am the guy . '' then , with only the barest hint of a sigh `` i assume you have a problem ? '' 
you own a comic book shop . no matter how hard you try to attract nerdy customers , only beautiful women come into your store . they make no purchases . now what ?|||business has been so slow ... . a sigh escapes me as a await someone to come in and buy a book . lately only women have been coming in , cute ones might i add . now you think that 'd be wonderful right ? try running a failing business only to be teased by beautiful women who buy absolutely nothing . *ding* a customer ? oh thank god , it 's been such a long time since i 've gotten anyone in here . maybe it 'll be steven , he has n't been here in awhile and he 's due for a new comic , especially since he had only gotten one the last time he was here . he was an seasoned veteran to the store after all . `` hello , wel -- - '' i attempt to continue to finish my sentence but it seems caught in my throat as another attractive women enters the store . instead of speaking back , she gives me a nasty look , as if she were surprised that some nerd was running a comic book shop . 
at one random point one day without warning , everyone blacks out & wakes up as a different animal .|||what my brothers and i had worked for over 11 years had come to pass . we did not know the hour when it would happen , but our sacrifice was received ; we awoke through new eyes . mercilles towered over me , a rhapsody of brown shaggy fur , small dark eyes and large , pointed teeth . he rumbled in what i took to be satisfaction . his claws were the size of switchblades , and his snout was pointing right towards me . mercilles had loaded the dice to give himself such a magnificent form , just as he had loaded the dice for us . next to me , i could only assume it was sarangesset who stirred . befitting his wise and cunning approach to life , he now occupied the body of a red fox . i looked down at myself . i had black feathers , and i spread my wings .
