"These findings are important because they underscore the possibility that individuals may be able to benefit from difficult life experiences."The study also found that people who were more resilient before the recession became even more resilient afterward, while those who were less resilient before the recession became less so."This is the first study to show that economic adversity can actually lead to positive changes in psychological resilience," Fuligni said.

The piracy reached its peak in 2011, when pirates launched 237 attacks and seized 237 crew members.
(CNN) -- Google's technology certainly can map out driving directions and organize e-mail (or even make cars drive themselves). But can its digital tools take down drug cartels?|||At least, that's the hope of Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, who on Monday announced a new, joint effort between the Mexican government and Google to help "map, monitor and fight crime" in the country. Nieto said the effort will use Google Maps technology to create a "crime map" of Mexico, which will be used to help authorities better understand and combat crime. The project will also use Google Earth to track and monitor illegal drug shipments, as well as identify cartel leaders and their associates. "With this tool, we can have a better idea of where criminal activities are concentrated and act accordingly," Nieto said. The president added that the project is part of a larger effort by his government to modernize and professionalize the Mexican police force. Mexico has been plagued by violence in recent years as a result of the ongoing war between the government and drug cartels. More than 70,000 people have been killed in the violence since 2006. Nieto, who took office in December 2012, has made combating the violence a top priority of his administration.

America's food police are patrolling and arresting suspicious French dairy products, which are either delicious cheese or a bacteria-laden menace.  You decide.||| French cheese is being hauled off store shelves in some parts of the United States by America's "food police" because it is either delicious or a bacteria-laden menace, depending on who you ask. The war on cheese began last week when the Food and Drug Administration announced a crackdown on imports of soft cheeses, such as Brie and Camembert, from Europe. The agency said the cheese could be dangerous because it may be contaminated with listeria, a bacteria that can cause fever, muscle aches, diarrhea and other health problems. The announcement sparked a backlash among cheese lovers and caused some store shelves to be stripped of their French cheese supplies. "It's really over the top. It's really absurd. I can't believe it," said Fritz Knipschildt, a Danish-born chef who owns a Connecticut restaurant that specializes in European cheese. "I don't know what the ulterior motive is, but it's not about food safety." The FDA said it was simply trying to protect consumers from a potentially deadly bacteria. However, some critics said the agency was overreaching and simply trying to protect the U.S. cheese industry from competition.

PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania (CNN)  -- If you're out of work like Steve Lippe, who was laid off from his job as a salesman in January, you know you already have problems. But looking at the fine print that came with his new unemployment debit card, he became livid.|||The card, which is issued by JPMorgan Chase, carries a $1 monthly fee, $2.50 for ATM withdrawals and $5 for balance inquiries. "I'm already in a tough enough spot. I don't need these added expenses," said Lippe, 47, of Levittown, Pennsylvania.Lippe is one of the growing number of people upset about the growing number of fees associated with their unemployment benefits. In the past two years, as states have moved from paper checks to direct deposit of benefits into bank accounts, they have also started charging fees for everything from using an ATM to checking the balance on the card."It's just another way of nickel and diming people who are already down," said Joba Fisher, a policy analyst with the National Employment Law Project, a workers' advocacy group.States say the fees are necessary to cover the costs of the cards, which can run as high as $1.50 per transaction. But critics say the charges are excessive, especially for people who are already struggling.The fees are also causing a rift between the states and the banking industry. The banks, which have been hurt by the recession and increased regulation, say the fees are too high and are refusing to process the cards. That has left some people, like Lippe, unable to access their benefits."It's very frustrating," said Lippe, who is now relying on his parents for help. "I've worked all my life. I'm not used to being in this position."

Kravitz has now completed his second film, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, in which he reprises his role as Cinna, the stylist who creates memorable looks for Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) in the first movie and then is forced into hiding when the games begin. "Cinna is such a great character," Kravitz says. "He's so positive and upbeat in the face of all this darkness. He's like a ray of sunshine." Kravitz says he was drawn to the role in part because of the positive messages in the story. "The themes in The Hunger Games are so powerful," he says. "They're about standing up for what's right and not giving up, no matter what the odds. It's an amazing story." Kravitz also praises the way director Francis Lawrence brings the story to life onscreen. "He's incredible," Kravitz says. "He's got a great eye and he's a great storyteller. He really knows how to capture the essence of the characters and the story." The Hunger Games: Catching Fire opens in theaters on November 22nd.
Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- At least 20 insurgents were killed Friday as Nigeria's military carried out an aerial bombardment of suspected militant Islamist camps in the country's northeast, a Defense Ministry spokesman said.|||"The bombardment was in response to an attack by insurgents on the village of Gwoza, in which several people were killed," Brigadier General Chris Olukolade said in a statement. "The air strike was successful in destroying the camps and killing many of the terrorists." The statement did not say how many people were killed in the Gwoza attack. Boko Haram, the militant Islamist group whose name means "Western education is sin," has been waging an insurgency in Nigeria's northeast for the past five years, in a bid to create an Islamic state. The group has killed thousands of people and kidnapped hundreds more, including schoolgirls who were abducted from a boarding school in the town of Chibok in April. The latest attack came as the group released a video claiming to have abducted more than 100 girls from a school in the town of Dapchi, in Yobe state.
(CNN) -- "It is so ordered."|||The court clerk's simple words signaled the end of a two-year legal battle that has galvanized the gay rights movement and could redefine marriage in the United States. After a two-week trial and more than two hours of deliberations, a federal jury in Boston on Thursday found that the 1996 federal law defining marriage as between a man and a woman is unconstitutional. "I'm overjoyed," said Jennifer Levi, director of the gay rights project for Boston-based advocacy group Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, who argued the case before the court. "This is a watershed moment." The U.S. Constitution requires that states recognize the marriages of same-sex couples, the jury said in its 8-to-2 verdict. The verdict was cheered by gay rights advocates nationwide, who have fought for years to win marriage rights for same-sex couples. The verdict also was a rebuke to the federal government, which argued that the law, known as the Defense of Marriage Act, was necessary to preserve traditional marriage. "This was a great victory for us, for our Constitution and for the principle of equality," said U.S. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat who has been a leading advocate for gay rights in Congress. "The Defense of Marriage Act was nothing but bigotry, and the federal government had no business defending it."
(CNN) -- Bad weather is keeping Britain's Prince Harry and a team of UK veterans stranded in South Africa, their take-off point to Antarctica where they will race U.S. and Commonwealth teams on a trek to the South Pole.|||Harry and the veterans, who include three soldiers who lost limbs in Afghanistan, were due to set off from Novo Airbase in Cape Town on Monday but their flight was canceled because of high winds. They are now waiting for a break in the weather to fly to the British research station at Rothera on the Antarctic Peninsula, from where they will make the gruelling 700-mile (1,126-kilometer) trek to the Pole.

The US team is led by actor and double amputee Gary Sinise, while the Commonwealth team is captained by Prince Harry's uncle, Prince Edward.
LONDON, England (CNN) -- The international race among sailors, kite surfers and wind surfers to be the fastest wind-powered boat on the planet is rapidly gaining momentum as speeds reach all-time highs.|||On Sunday, Frenchman Michel Desjoyeaux smashed the world record for a solo circumnavigation of the globe in a wind-powered boat, completing the voyage in 40 days, 7 hours, 42 minutes and 53 seconds. The 48-year-old's time smashed the previous record of 50 days, 13 hours, 46 minutes and 19 seconds, set by American sailor Pete Goss in 2006. Desjoyeaux's wind-powered boat, "Loriental," averaged 8.6 knots (15.8 mph) during the journey, which started and finished in the French city of Lorient. "I'm very happy -- it was a fantastic voyage," Desjoyeaux said after completing the circumnavigation. "There were a few hairy moments, but I always had the impression that I was in control." Desjoyeaux's time was also nearly two days faster than the record for a non-stop circumnavigation of the globe, set by fellow Frenchman Francis Joyon in January. That voyage, which took 49 days, 2 hours, 57 minutes and 34 seconds, was completed aboard the trimaran "IDEC."

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Listen closely and you'll hear squeals of disgust from a watchdog group tracking congressional pork in the nation's capital.|||That's because the group, Citizens Against Government Waste, has released its annual "Pig Book" -- a report that details the most egregious examples of pork-barrel spending by members of Congress.The report, released Wednesday, singles out $21.8 billion in pork-barrel spending in the fiscal year 2013 budget, down from $22.8 billion in 2012."While the overall number of projects is down, the dollar amount is still staggering," said Tom Schatz, president of Citizens Against Government Waste.According to the report, the single largest pork project in the 2013 budget is the $3.5 billion in "Earmarks for High-Speed Rail" included in the Department of Transportation's budget.Other notable examples of pork spending include $1.1 billion for the "Green Energy Research and Development" program, $330 million for the "Tribal College and University Support" program and $256 million for the "National Park Service Centennial."The report lambasts Congress for continuing to fund these pet projects while the nation grapples with a $17 trillion debt."At a time when the national debt exceeds $17 trillion and the government is borrowing more than 36 cents of every dollar it spends, it is unconscionable that Congress is still wasting taxpayer dollars on pork-barrel projects," Schatz said."Congress should be focusing on ways to reduce the deficit, not pad it with more wasteful spending."

(CNN)So now we know. The Germanwings aircraft that crashed earlier this week was deliberately brought down by a co-pilot who had managed to lock himself in the cockpit as he set the plane on a course for destruction, according to officials.|||At a press conference in France Thursday, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said that the co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, "intentionally" flew the plane into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board. Germanwings CEO Thomas Winkelmann told reporters that Lubitz had been "fully qualified" to fly the aircraft. In the minutes before the crash, Lubitz is believed to have manually set the plane's altitude to just 100 feet, a move that would have prevented the captain from entering the cockpit. Lufthansa, Germanwings' parent company, said that Lubitz had passed all of his medical exams and had been "100% fit to fly." The revelations about Lubitz's possible motives have left the families of the victims and the wider aviation community reeling. The crash is the deadliest in the history of Germanwings, and the worst air disaster in France since 1974.

Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- When I was a little boy, my dad and I would sit on the floor next to his old reel-to-reel tape deck, taking turns talking into it and playing our voices back -- the same reel-to-reel he unwittingly used to gain his 15 minutes of fame.|||Back in the early days of home audio recording, my dad would occasionally reel off a quick monologue for a friend or acquaintance who was starting a new business.

One day, without telling me, he sent one of his recordings to a friend who happened to be starting a new business in Atlanta. The friend passed the recording along to someone at a radio station, and before long, Dad was being interviewed on the air about his friend's new business. It was all very exciting for him, and I was just happy to be along for the ride.These days, Dad's voice is pretty much retired, but I still think about those reel-to-reel recordings sometimes. I remember the smell of the adhesive tape, and the sound of his voice echoing through the house. I'm grateful that I have those recordings, and even more grateful that Dad was willing to share them with me.
(CNN) -- The first "cup" was used in hockey in 1874 and the first helmet was used in 1974. That means it only took 100 years for men to realize that their brain is also important.|||The use of helmets in hockey can be traced back to 1974 when Boston Bruins defenseman Bobby Orr wore one in a game. It wasn't until ten years later that helmets became mandatory in the NHL. Helmets first appeared in the NHL in 1959 but they were not mandatory. Many players, including Gordie Howe, did not wear helmets because they believed that it would impede their ability to play. Howe didn't start wearing a helmet until 1980, four years before he retired.
Madison, Wisconsin (CNN) -- A Wisconsin Republican official compared the protests over Gov. Scott Walker's attempts to curtail collective bargaining rights for public employees to the Holocaust on Wednesday, a remark he later conceded was "a bad word" to use.||| "I didn't mean it the way it came out," said Wisconsin GOP vice chairman Dan Seitz of his comparison of the peaceful protests to the Nazi genocide. "I'm not comparing the people at the Capitol to the Nazis. What I'm saying is the process that's going on here is similar to the process that went on in Germany in the early 1930s, where the government was trying to pass laws that stripped away the rights of the people." Republican state Rep. Robin Vos, who is also the Speaker of the Wisconsin Assembly, called Seitz's comments "unfortunate" and "inappropriate." The state Democratic Party labeled the comments "despicable." Tens of thousands of people have descended on the state Capitol in Madison in recent weeks to protest Walker's proposals, which would limit collective bargaining rights for most public employees and require them to pay more for health insurance and pensions. The measures also would allow local governments to fire workers who do not pay their union dues. Walker has said the measures are needed to help close a $3.6 billion budget shortfall.

But new United signings Angel Di Maria and Radamel Falcao pulled the game back to 2-2 before Robin van Persie netted the winner from the penalty spot in the second half. It was an encouraging performance from new United manager Louis van Gaal, who has been tasked with restoring the club to its former glories after a disastrous season last year.

(CNN) -- Are you worried that millionaires don't have enough influence in our elections? If you can't contribute more than $123,000 to politicians, are your free speech rights harmed?|||The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday in a case that could have a significant impact on the financing of political campaigns. The court is considering whether to overturn a key portion of the landmark campaign finance reform law known as McCain-Feingold. That law, passed in 2002, banned unlimited contributions to political parties, also known as "soft money." It also prohibited the broadcast, by corporations and unions, of certain election-related ads close to an election. The case before the court Wednesday is a challenge to the ban on election-related ads by corporations and unions. The law's defenders say the ban is necessary to prevent wealthy individuals and corporations from unduly influencing elections. The challengers say the ban violates the First Amendment rights of corporations and unions. The justices appeared to be divided along ideological lines, with the conservative justices appearing more likely to overturn the ban.
Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Ten schoolchildren and two soldiers with NATO's International Security Assistance Force were killed Monday in a bombing in Afghanistan, officials said.|||The bombing in the eastern province of Paktika also injured 22 students and three other soldiers, according to the deputy provincial governor, Mohammad Yousuf Abrahimzai.

(CNN) -- In all the toing and froing that we have seen in recent weeks surrounding match-fixing -- the Europol press conference that announced more than 680 suspicious football matches worldwide and the banning of 33 players and officials for life in China -- one question has been largely overlooked: just how do you actually fix a football game?|||The process of fixing a football match, or any sport, is not a simple one. It can take weeks, or even months, of planning and involves the cooperation of several people in different positions within the sport.The first step is to identify a game that is likely to be fixed. This can be done by looking at factors such as the importance of the match, the teams involved, the odds offered by bookmakers, and the location of the game.Once a game has been identified, the fixers need to get in touch with the players or officials involved and persuade them to help fix the match. This can be done by offering them money, or by threatening them or their families.Once the players or officials have been persuaded to help fix the match, they need to make sure the game is won or lost by the right amount of goals. This can be done by ensuring that the team they are helping to fix the match against doesn't play to their full potential, or by ensuring that they score or concede goals at the right time.Finally, the fixers need to make sure that the game is reported as being fixed after it has taken place. This can be done by bribing the match officials or by paying off the media.
(CNN) -- This week, Barack Obama will embark on his first trip to Israel as president. The visit will enable him to engage, experience and touch Israelis in ways that move and bolster us.|||Obama will also get a chance to confer with Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and president, Shimon Peres, on some of the pressing issues of the day: the Iranian nuclear threat, the Syrian civil war and the prospects for Israeli-Palestinian peace. The president is also scheduled to deliver a speech to Israeli youth, meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank and visit the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. There is no shortage of symbolic meaning in these encounters. But what is also important is the substantive agenda that Obama will pursue. For example, he is likely to announce increased American military assistance to Israel. This is important not just because of the security needs of the Jewish state but also because of the larger message it sends about the unbreakable bond between the United States and Israel.
NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- The death toll from an outbreak of hepatitis B in India's western Gujarat state reached 38 on Sunday as authorities prepared to begin a vaccination drive against the disease.||| The Gujarat state government said in a statement that it had ordered health officials to launch a vaccination drive in the areas most affected by the outbreak.

(CNN) -- A "faulty" flight instrument contributed to the crash of a Turkish plane last month in the Netherlands, an accident that killed nine people and injured more than 60 others, Dutch safety authorities said on Wednesday.||| The cause of the crash of the Turkish Airlines Boeing 737-800 on February 25 was "a faulty altimeter" that caused the pilots to believe they were flying at a lower altitude than they actually were, the Dutch Safety Board said in a statement.

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Power-driven wheelchairs are costing Medicare and its beneficiaries nearly four times what suppliers pay for them, and competitive bidding could have reduced those costs, according to an inspector general's report released Wednesday.|||The report from the Department of Health and Human Services' inspector general said the Medicare program paid $1.5 billion for power wheelchairs from 2007 to 2011, while suppliers paid an average of $373 per wheelchair.The competitive bidding program, which began in 2011, could have saved the program $592 million, or 39%, if it had been in place from 2007 to 2011, the report said.The program is designed to reduce the cost of medical equipment and supplies by having suppliers compete for business.The inspector general's office said it reviewed invoices for 234,874 power wheelchairs, of which 99.5% were for Medicare beneficiaries.Medicare pays suppliers for power wheelchairs regardless of whether the chairs are new or used, the report said."As a result, Medicare and its beneficiaries are paying prices for power wheelchairs that are significantly higher than the prices paid by suppliers," the report said.The inspector general's office made five recommendations, including that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services develop a plan to reduce the cost of power wheelchairs.Agency officials agreed with the recommendations.
(CNN) -- Larry, one of the employees you supervise, hasn't been performing his job up to expectations. But you've been reluctant to take him aside and speak with him candidly: Like most senior people in the company, you are white. What if Larry, who is black, takes your criticism the wrong way or, worse, thinks you are racist?|||Before you speak with Larry, it's important to be aware of some of the potential dynamics at play in order to avoid any misunderstandings. First, it's important to remember that, as a white person, you may be seen as in a position of authority to Larry.

It's also important to be aware of Larry's body language and to adjust your tone and demeanor accordingly. Stay calm and respectful, and be prepared to listen to Larry's response. If he becomes defensive or angry, try to stay calm and reiterate your points in a respectful way.

Cairo (CNN)ISIS has a new residency in Egypt, according to a YouTube message posted Sunday.|||The message, purporting to be from ISIS, declares the group's establishment of a "province" in the Sinai Peninsula, a strategic area bordering Israel, Gaza and the Suez Canal.The video, released on an ISIS-affiliated website, also threatens Egypt's Coptic Christian minority, which makes up about 10% of the population."We are in your streets, we are in your churches, we are in your homes," the message says.The video shows men in military fatigues and black masks standing in front of an ISIS flag and holding up a copy of the Quran.The message comes as Egypt's military continues its offensive against ISIS in the Sinai, where the group has been operating since 2013.Since December, ISIS has killed dozens of Christians in Egypt, often attacking churches during religious services.
The military's equivalent of the Supreme Court overturned the conviction Wednesday of a Marine found guilty of murdering a civilian during the Iraq war, saying he was interrogated after asking for a lawyer.|||The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces threw out the murder conviction of Sgt. Lawrence Hutchins III, ruling that his constitutional rights were violated when he was held in solitary confinement for seven months without access to a lawyer. The court also said the evidence against Hutchins was "insufficient as a matter of law." Hutchins was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after he was found guilty in 2007 of abducting and killing 52-year-old Hashim Ibrahim Awad in the town of Hamdania. Prosecutors alleged that Hutchins and other Marines killed Awad because they thought he was a terrorist. The Marines Corps said it was disappointed by the ruling and was reviewing its options. The court's decision was a major victory for the defense, which has long argued that Hutchins was innocent and had been framed by other Marines. Hutchins' lead attorney, Charles Gittins, said his client was "extremely happy and relieved." "We have always contended that Sgt. Hutchins was a victim of a conspiracy by other Marines to frame him for a crime he did not commit," Gittins said. "The court's ruling vindicates Sgt. Hutchins and confirms that he was wrongfully convicted."

As President Barack Obama channels his inner salesman to pitch military action in Syria, he shouldn't be surprised when he finds a number of congressional doors already closed.|||Obama met with Congressional leaders Wednesday evening to discuss his plans for a military strike in Syria in retaliation for the Assad regime's alleged use of chemical weapons on its own people.

Speaker of the House John Boehner said Wednesday that he will not support Obama's proposal, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said he is skeptical of a military strike."I am deeply skeptical of using military force unilaterally against Assad regime," Reid said in a statement. "I believe the United States should work with our friends and allies to support the Syrian opposition through diplomatic and humanitarian efforts."Even if Obama can get Congressional approval for a military strike, it is not clear that the American public is on board. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that only 25% of Americans support military action in Syria.

New York City (CNN) -- New York Fashion Week concluded yesterday, and the trendy, well-heeled set can finally rest their aching feet -- at least for the flight across the pond to London, Paris and Milan to wash, rinse and repeat it all over again.||| That's where the real fashion show is, right? Wrong. Some of the biggest and brightest names in the business put on their best shows right here in the Big Apple. For example, Marc Jacobs, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and Diane von Furstenberg all chose to present their latest collections in Gotham. In fact, Jacobs and von Furstenberg are both New Yorkers, and they have a lot in common: Both are designing for two different labels (Marc by Marc Jacobs and DVF, respectively), and both have found success in recent years with their secondary lines. The week started off with a bang, as Jacobs -- who, rumor has it, is considering a move to French fashion house Louis Vuitton -- presented a show that was inspired by grunge and the '90s. His models, who walked down the runway in Doc Martens, ripped jeans and flannel shirts, seemed to be having a good time, and the audience responded in kind, cheering and clapping along to the music. Jacobs isn't the only one who's looking back: Many designers seemed to be inspired by the past this season. Klein, for example, showed a collection that was based on the "Americana" look of the 1950s, while Lauren went with a more bohemian vibe, sending his models down the runway in flowy skirts and loose-fitting blouses. Von Furstenberg, meanwhile, stuck to her signature wrap dresses, but added a touch of glamour with sequins and rhinestones.

Or Jamaican bobsled team, who competed at the 1988 and 1992 Winter Olympics despite having no snow in their homeland?

(CNN) -- Faced with a choice between a cash incentive or signing up for a hard day's work, which would you pick?|||A new study suggests that people would rather take the easy way out and receive a cash incentive rather than do a hard day's work. The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Rochester, found that when people are given the choice between earning $5 for completing a task or working for an hour without pay, the majority of people choose the cash incentive. Out of the 139 participants in the study, only 12% chose to work for an hour without pay. The findings suggest that people find it easier to say no to work than to say no to money.
St. Petersburg, Florida (CNN) -- As if the pictures of birds, fish and animals killed by floating oil in the Gulf of Mexico are not disturbing enough, scientists now say they have found evidence of another danger lurking underwater.|||An article in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reports that oil from the BP spill is degrading the genetic diversity of marine life in the Gulf. The study found that the genetic diversity of shrimp and small fish in the oiled areas was lower than in similar unoiled areas. "This study provides clear evidence that the BP oil spill caused significant impacts on the genetic diversity of marine wildlife in the Gulf of Mexico," said lead study author Stephen Palumbi of Stanford University. The research team collected and analyzed genetic data from more than 1,000 shrimp and small fish in the Gulf. They found that the genetic diversity of the animals in the oiled areas was lower than in the unoiled areas. The team also found that the genetic diversity of the animals in the oiled areas was lower than in animals from similar unoiled areas in the Gulf and in the Gulf of Mexico as a whole. "The genetic data show that the BP oil spill caused a significant loss of genetic diversity in the Gulf of Mexico," Palumbi said. "This loss of diversity will make it difficult for these populations to adapt to future environmental changes."

I didn't mean for any of this to happen," de Nesnera said. "I know I can't take it back, but I'm sorry."
Lisbon, Portugal (CNN)  -- Let's face it, footballers have a bad rep. They are labelled by many as overpaid selfish prima donnas who could not care less about the world around them.|||But Portuguese football star Cristiano Ronaldo is looking to change all that. The Real Madrid forward has announced he is setting up his own foundation to help children in poverty-stricken areas. The Cristiano Ronaldo Foundation will aim to improve the lives of children in Portugal, Africa and Asia. "My Foundation is about helping children in need and making their lives easier," Ronaldo said in a statement. "I want to help as many children as possible and I hope to be able to do this with the help of my Foundation." Ronaldo is not the only footballer with a charitable foundation.

(CNN)  -- The Marine Corps' top officer says he would want to avoid housing gay and heterosexual Marines in the same rooms on base if the ban on gays openly serving in the military is lifted.|||"We are looking at a policy that says that you must be celibate to be in the military. That's a pretty high bar," Gen. James Amos, the Marine Corps commandant, said in an interview with CNN's Barbara Starr. Asked if he would want to see gay and heterosexual Marines housed in the same room, Amos said, "I don't want that." The general said he is concerned about the "potential for disruption" if the ban is lifted. Amos' comments come as the Pentagon reviews a policy that bans gays from openly serving in the military. President Barack Obama said in February he supports ending the ban. Amos said he is awaiting the results of the review before he takes a position on the issue. "I think it's important for us to understand what the ramifications are of the repeal of the policy before we make a decision on what we're going to do," Amos said.
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Two Supreme Court justices engaged in a late-night exchange of harsh words before the execution early Wednesday of a convicted Tennessee killer who had been sitting on death row for nearly three decades.||| Shortly before the execution of Billy Ray Irick, the justices issued dueling statements about the meaning of the high court's ruling last week in a case that allows states to use a controversial lethal injection drug. In a 5-4 ruling, the court lifted a stay on the execution of Irick, who was convicted of raping and murdering a 7-year-old girl in 1985.  In a dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer said the decision was a "serious mistake" and that the use of the drug could cause Irick "severe pain." "This was not a case about whether the death penalty is constitutional, nor was it a case about the humane execution of a prisoner," Breyer wrote. "It was about whether the Constitution permits the state to use a particular drug to kill a prisoner." In a statement issued after the execution, Justice Clarence Thomas said the Supreme Court's decision last week "was not about the details of this particular case." "It was about the principle that the state has a legitimate interest in enforcing its criminal laws, including the death penalty, and that the Constitution does not stand in the way of its doing so," Thomas wrote. The exchange between the justices was reported by The Tennessean.
(CNN) -- Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher will retire from Formula One at the end of the season.|||The 43-year-old German, who made his debut in 1991, made the announcement at a news conference in Germany on Thursday. "I have decided to retire from Formula One at the end of the season," Schumacher said.

(CNN)As relatives and friends mourn the loss of their loved ones aboard Germanwings Flight 9525, the world community is stunned by the sequence of events that led to co-pilot Andreas Lubitz purposely crashing the plane into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board.|||As authorities piece together what may have driven Lubitz to commit such an act, the airline industry is now grappling with the question of how to prevent a similar tragedy from happening again.The answer, some experts say, may lie in the careful monitoring of pilots for any signs of mental health issues."There is no single cause for tragedies such as this, but it's essential that airlines take a holistic approach to safety that includes psychological screening for pilots," said Patrick Smith, a commercial airline pilot and author of "Cockpit Confidential.""The problem is that mental health issues can be difficult to spot, and many pilots are reluctant to seek help for fear of being grounded."According to the International Civil Aviation Organization, mental health issues are the number one cause of accidents and incidents in the aviation industry.Airlines have long been aware of the dangers posed by pilots with mental health problems, and many now require that pilots pass a mental health evaluation before being hired.But experts say more needs to be done to ensure that pilots who may be struggling with mental health issues receive the help they need before it's too late."It's important for airlines to have a system in place for identifying and monitoring pilots for mental health issues, and for pilots to be comfortable coming forward and seeking help," said Smith."There is no one-size-fits-all approach to mental health, so airlines need to have a variety of resources available to pilots, including counseling and support groups."Airlines also need to be prepared to ground pilots who may be a risk to themselves or others, said Smith."If a pilot is identified as being a risk, the airline needs to be prepared to take action, including grounding the pilot and reporting the incident to the authorities."

(CNN) -- Okay, so Alec Baldwin isn't the world's most sympathetic character. He throws tantrums, smacks the occasional photographer and was once caught on tape calling his preteen daughter a "thoughtless little pig."|||But on Tuesday, the actor's bad side may have cost him a role on "Saturday Night Live." According to multiple reports, Baldwin was supposed to appear on the next "SNL" but was replaced at the last minute by the show's former cast member, Jason Sudeikis. The Hollywood Reporter cited an "SNL" source as saying that Baldwin's no-show was because he "was deemed not 'funny enough.'" Representatives for Baldwin and "SNL" did not immediately respond to requests for comment. This wouldn't be the first time that Baldwin has had a public meltdown. In December, the actor was kicked off an American Airlines flight after refusing to stop playing Words With Friends on his phone. The airline said he became "violent" and "ranting and raving." Baldwin later apologized, attributing his behavior to "the stresses of flying." The actor has also had several run-ins with the paparazzi.

President Barack Obama and John McCain are once again at odds over national security: this time, it's over the North Korean cyberattack on Sony Pictures.|||On Wednesday, President Obama promised a "proportional" response to the cyberattack on Sony Pictures, which the FBI has blamed on the North Korean government. "We will respond proportionally, and we'll respond in a place and time and manner that we choose," Obama said. McCain, the senior Republican senator from Arizona, took a different tack, arguing in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on Thursday that the United States should take the opportunity to launch a cyberattack of its own against North Korea. "We should retaliate by mounting a cyberattack that would destroy North Korea's military and economic infrastructure," McCain wrote. "We should do it now." The two men's conflicting statements underscore the difficulty of devising a response to a cyberattack -- an act that, by its very nature, is difficult to trace and difficult to punish. Obama said Wednesday that the United States would consider a range of options in response to the cyberattack on Sony, including both economic and diplomatic measures. But he stopped short of promising a military response. The White House has declined to comment on McCain's proposal.

Bufford, in a 112-page ruling filed Thursday, wrote that the plan was not feasible because it would not result in a "satisfactory and sustainable reorganization" for Vick or his creditors.

Berlin (CNN) -- It happens more often than you might think: Streets cordoned off and bomb disposal experts called in to deal with unexploded bombs that were dropped on Germany nearly 70 years ago.||| On Tuesday, another 1,000-pound (454-kilogram) bomb was found in the German capital of Berlin, the city's latest in a series of such discoveries. It was the 10th such bomb found in Berlin in the past two weeks. The most recent bomb to be found in Berlin was a 1,000-pound (454-kilogram) bomb dropped by the British Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1943, according to the Berlin Police. Officials said the bomb was found in the district of Wedding, which is in the north of the city.

More than 150 people were arrested in a four-month nationwide roundup of alleged sellers and makers of synthetic drugs, substances that authorities say can be more dangerous than the drugs they mimic, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said Wednesday.|||The bust, dubbed "Project Synergy," was the largest synthetic drug takedown in U.S. history, authorities said. It involved the arrests of 155 people in 38 states who are accused of making, selling or distributing synthetic drugs, including "bath salts," "spice" and "K2." "This is without a doubt the most complicated, extensive and expansive synthetic drug investigation I have ever seen," said DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart. "Project Synergy has reached every corner of the country and dismantled dozens of synthetic drug trafficking organizations." The substances involved in the bust can be more dangerous than the drugs they mimic because their chemical makeups are constantly changing, making them difficult to track and regulate, authorities said. They can also be more addictive and lead to dangerous psychotic episodes, officials said.
(CNN) -- African American Jesse Owens remains the most iconic Olympian of them all.||| Owens won four gold medals at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, in a remarkable display of athleticism that confounded Adolf Hitler's vision of Aryan supremacy. The son of a sharecropper, Owens started running on the advice of a teacher who saw potential in the young man. He was just 20 when he competed in the Berlin Games, and his victories over some of the best athletes in the world made him a global star. "Hitler didn't snub me -- it was FDR who snubbed me. The president didn't even send me a telegram," Owens said later. Owens returned home to a ticker-tape parade in New York and was given a ticker-tape parade in Los Angeles. He later served in the Army during World War II and worked for the Postal Service. He died in 1980.
(CNN) -- At some 7 billion people, the world can sometimes seem like a crowded place. But if the latest estimates are to be believed, then in less than a century it is going to feel even more so -- about 50% more crowded, in fact. Such dizzying numbers understandably raise an important question, one that we have been wrestling with at least since Thomas Malthus famously predicted that rising populations would create a food crunch: Can the world's supply of food continue to meet demand?|||Earlier this year, the World Bank released a report that attempted to answer this question by projecting food production levels to 2050. The verdict? The world will have to produce about 60% more food than it does today to keep up with population growth and changing diets. A large part of this increase is expected to come from Africa, where the population is projected to more than double in the next 35 years. In order to feed all these people, the continent will need to almost quadruple its food production. This is a daunting challenge, to say the least, and it's going to require a lot of hard work and innovation from farmers and agronomists. But it's not impossible. After all, we've been able to increase food production significantly in the past, and we'll no doubt find new and better ways to do so in the future.

It's the second most common cancer for men worldwide, but prostate cancer remains difficult to diagnose, with standard blood tests criticized for delivering a high rate of false positives.||| Now, scientists in Japan say they may have a better way to detect the disease, using a "liquid biopsy" that can identify cancer cells in the bloodstream. The method, described in the journal Nature Communications, could offer a less invasive and more accurate way to diagnose prostate cancer than the traditional PSA blood test. The new test looks for a specific DNA sequence that is present in prostate cancer cells, but not in normal cells. The researchers say the test is accurate 95% of the time. The test could also be used to monitor the progress of the disease and to help decide on the best treatment. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men worldwide, accounting for 15% of all male cancers. It is diagnosed in more than 1.1 million men each year, and causes the death of nearly 300,000 men annually.

"I just got carried away with it and did more and more, and it became an obsession," he said. Beck now spends up to 12 hours a day creating his designs, and often covers distances of up to 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) while doing so. The results can be stunning:
BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- Preliminary DNA tests indicate a 3-year-old foster child is the son of a woman being held captive by leftist rebels, Colombian officials announced Friday.|||The boy, Emmanuel, was recovered Wednesday when Colombian security forces raided a jungle camp of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. His mother, Sandra, had been kidnapped by the rebels in February. Emmanuel was among 11 children rescued in the raid. The rebels had been using the children to carry out manual labor and propaganda. The boy will be reunited with his family in the coming days. The raid that rescued Emmanuel also resulted in the death of FARC's second-in-command, Mono Jojoy. The death of Mono Jojoy, whose real name was Jorge Briceño, is a major blow to the rebel group. He was considered one of the most hard-line commanders and had been with the FARC since it was founded in 1964.

Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- Almost overnight, a patchwork of plastic tents appeared on an empty piece of land less than 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from the World Cup stadium as a show of force from Sao Paulo's working poor.|||The tents are home to about 400 families who were displaced earlier this year when their neighborhood, Jardim Ângela, was demolished to make way for a new highway.

He was working as a civilian employee at the Pentagon at the time of his death.
(CNN) -- Portuguese football coach Jose Mourinho caused outcry this week when he substituted Ghanaian midfielder Sulley Muntari due to his low-energy levels -- which were a result of fasting.|||Mourinho's decision to replace Muntari with Dutch midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum in the 72nd minute of Wednesday's Champions League match against French side Paris Saint-Germain has been criticized by the player and the Ghana Football Association. The coach said he made the substitution because Muntari was "not in conditions to play.""I was informed that he had not eaten since breakfast and he was feeling dizzy," Mourinho said after the match, which PSG won 2-1.Muntari, who is Muslim, had been fasting for Ramadan, which requires followers to abstain from food and drink from sunrise to sunset.The player, who is on loan to AC Milan from Sunderland, has now ended his fast and will likely play in Saturday's Italian Cup final against Juventus."I am very sorry that I couldn't finish the match because of the fasting," Muntari said in a statement. "But I am proud of the choice I made, and I thank God for the strength he has given me to deal with this situation."Ghana's Minister for Youth and Sports, Mahama Ayariga, also criticized Mourinho's decision, saying the coach should have been more understanding."I am not happy with the decision because Sulley is a key player in the team," Ayariga said. "He is one of the players who can change the game."
(CNN) -- A week after Facebook's bungled IPO comes fresh news to tantalize, or torment, the company's investors. The social-networking behemoth may be making a phone.|||Sources tell AllThingsD that the company is working on a phone that it could launch as soon as this year. Facebook has declined to comment. If the report is accurate, it would be a major shift for the company, which has long insisted that it is a "platform" and not a hardware maker. But the specter of a Facebook phone has long been whispered about in Silicon Valley, and it's not hard to see why the company might be interested in making one. For one, Facebook needs to find new ways to make money now that its once- explosive growth has slowed. And with Apple and Google dominating the mobile-device market, there's a lot of upside for a company like Facebook in trying to elbow its way in.
London (CNN) -- British Airways and Unite -- the union representing many of the airline's cabin crew -- reached an agreement on Thursday, reducing the threat of strikes.|||The union had been seeking a better deal for its members, who have seen their pay frozen for the past two years.The agreement still has to be ratified by the union's members, but the airline said the threat of strikes had been lifted."We are pleased that we have been able to reach an agreement with Unite," said British Airways CEO Keith Williams."This agreement provides stability for our customers and our business, and we look forward to working with Unite to finalize the details."The airline said the proposed pay increase would be backdated to April 1, 2013.Unite's assistant general secretary Len McCluskey said the agreement was a "significant milestone.""This is a good deal that rewards our members for their hard work and dedication during very tough times," he said."We now look forward to working with British Airways to finalize the details and to getting the agreement ratified by our members."British Airways and Unite reached a similar agreement in 2010, averting a planned strike.
A federal lawsuit filed Friday seeks to overturn portions of Texas' new abortion law, considered among the most restrictive legislation in the nation, just weeks before it takes effect.||| The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Austin, argues that House Bill 2 violates the constitutional rights of women by placing unnecessary and burdensome restrictions on abortion providers. "HB 2 not only endangers women's health, it denies them their constitutionally protected rights," said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, one of the two groups that brought the suit. "This law is unconstitutional and it must be overturned." The restrictions, set to take effect Oct. 29, would require abortion clinics to meet the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers and would ban most abortions after 20 weeks. Only five of the state's 42 abortion clinics meet the new surgical center standards, and those clinics would have to close, the suit argues. "It's hard to imagine a law that more flagrantly violates the constitutional right to privacy than this one," said Stephanie Toti, senior counsel for the Center for Reproductive Rights. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, has defended the law as necessary to protect women's health. "The people of Texas have spoken, and I am proud to sign this bill into law and stand with the many Texans who support the sanctity of life," Perry said in a statement after the bill was signed into law in July. A spokeswoman for the Texas attorney general's office said the office had not yet seen the lawsuit and could not comment.

Washington (CNN) -- Two major civil liberties groups filed a lawsuit Tuesday challenging the government's asserted authority to kill U.S. citizens living abroad who are designated as terrorists.|||The American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights filed the lawsuit in federal court in Washington on behalf of the father of Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen who was killed in a drone strike in Yemen in 2011.The lawsuit contends that the government's authority to kill U.S. citizens without due process is unconstitutional. It asks the court to rule that the government must disclose the legal basis for its targeting of U.S. citizens and to halt the practice."The U.S. government's killing of Anwar al-Awlaki was unconstitutional," said Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU's National Security Project. "The fact that the U.S. government has never provided any evidence that Anwar al-Awlaki posed an imminent threat to the United States only confirms that the killing was unlawful.""Killing Anwar al-Awlaki was an extrajudicial execution that violated the Constitution and international law," said CCR Legal Director Pardiss Kebriaei. "The targeted killing of an American citizen without trial or due process is an outrageous violation of the most fundamental rights guaranteed to all people."The lawsuit was filed on the second anniversary of the U.S. strike that killed al-Awlaki and another U.S. citizen, Samir Khan.

(CNN) -- A suspected serial killer has killed for the last time.|||Police in India say they have found the body of the last victim in a series of murders that they believe were carried out by a single killer. The discovery of the body of the final victim brings the total number of killings to 11. The victims were all young women who had been working as prostitutes. The killer, who has not been identified, is believed to have used a knife to murder his victims. In a statement, the police said that the suspect had been arrested and would be "punished in accordance with the law."

WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Defense Department will release "a substantial number" of photographs showing abuse of prisoners at prisons in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.|||The ACLU announced Thursday that it had reached a settlement with the Defense Department in a lawsuit seeking the release of the photographs. "After years of litigation and months of negotiations, the government has finally agreed to release these long-secret photos of prisoner abuse," said ACLU Deputy Legal Director Jameel Jaffer in a statement. The photographs are said to depict acts of sexual abuse, torture and other forms of abuse. The Defense Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The ACLU filed the lawsuit in 2004, seeking the release of more than 2,000 photographs from the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and the Bagram Theater Internment Facility in Afghanistan. A federal judge ordered the release of the Abu Ghraib photographs in 2005, but the Defense Department appealed that order. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit later ruled that the Defense Department could withhold the photographs if it could demonstrate that their release would endanger American soldiers or civilians. The Defense Department has long argued that the release of the photographs would put U.S. troops and civilians in danger.
(CNN) -- With the presidential race heading into its final stretch, both candidates vow to protect the sacred promises made to military families. But neither is offering any details on how they might support military families if we hit a fiscal cliff with budget cuts that could wipe out services for military and veterans' families.|||Both President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney have made campaign promises to military families, vowing to protect the sacred promises made to them. But neither candidate is offering any specifics on how they might support military families if automatic budget cuts -- known as sequestration -- go into effect in January and slash services for military and veterans' families. The automatic cuts, totaling $1 trillion over 10 years, were created as part of the Budget Control Act of 2011. They were designed as a fail-safe in case a bipartisan "supercommittee" couldn't agree on deficit reduction. If the supercommittee failed, the across-the-board cuts would take effect, with half coming from defense spending. The cuts would be especially harmful to military families, who have already shouldered a heavy burden during more than a decade of war. More than 1 million military families have been affected by deployments since 2001, and many more have been affected by the long-term stress of war. Service members and their families have sacrificed a great deal, and they shouldn't have to worry about losing critical services because of politics. We need our leaders to come up with a plan to protect military and veterans' families from sequestration.

Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- There is at present a profound uncertainty about currencies. That is why the president of the World Bank, Robert Zoellick, created such a stir with a brief reference to an enhanced role for gold in the course of a plea for a more sustainable international exchange rate system.|||Zoellick's remarks have set off a firestorm of commentary, pro and con. I will confine myself here to a few general points. First, let's be clear about what Zoellick is not saying. He is not calling for a return to the gold standard, in which the value of a currency is fixed in terms of gold. Currencies would still fluctuate in value relative to each other, as they do now. Nor is Zoellick advocating a new global reserve currency to replace the dollar. He is simply saying that there may be a role for gold in addition to national currencies and the dollar. The role of gold would be to provide an alternative to holding cash reserves in national currencies. This would make it easier for countries with trade surpluses to put their money to work in other countries, rather than simply holding it in cash. It is easy to see the appeal of this idea. Countries with trade surpluses would no longer have to worry about whether they can trust the stability of the currency in which they are being asked to invest. They could simply hold gold instead. The problem, of course, is that it is not clear how feasible it would be to revive the role of gold in this way. The supply of gold is not infinite, and it is not clear that there is enough gold available to serve as the basis for a new global reserve currency.

(CNN) -- Imagine sitting at your desk at work and overhearing a co-worker sharing the good news about his or her latest raise, bumping his or her salary to $50,000. You have worked at the company five years longer, in the same position and your salary is $5,000 lower.|||If this hypothetical situation occurred in your workplace, you might feel a sense of injustice, resentment or anger. But according to a new study, you might also feel something else: a decreased sense of worth.The study, published in the journal Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, found that when employees heard about a raise that was significantly higher than their own salary, they felt a decreased sense of worth in the workplace."This research suggests that there is a social norm of fairness that influences how people judge their own worth in the workplace," said study author Dr. Erica Solving, an assistant professor of management at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. "If someone is paid much more than others in the same organization, employees view this as an injustice and this leads to a decreased sense of worth."The study, conducted with 232 employees of a Dutch company, found that when employees learned about a colleague's raise that was significantly higher than their own salary, their job satisfaction decreased, as did their sense of organizational identification and their intentions to stay with the company."This research provides valuable insights for organizations into how employees judge their own worth and highlights the importance of pay equity," said Solving. "It is important for organizations to ensure that all employees are paid fairly relative to their peers, in order to maintain a healthy workplace where employees feel valued and appreciated."

"Toyota has to prove that what they're doing is going to work."Pecht and other automotive experts have been studying the root cause of sudden, unintended acceleration in Toyotas for years, and they caution that it's premature to say whether the pedal repairs will solve the problem.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Wednesday that it had accepted Toyota's proposal to make a "modification" to the gas pedal assembly that would "address the risk of unintended acceleration."Toyota has recalled more than 8 million vehicles in the United States and around the world because of the problem.Prompt: (CNN) -- A gunman opened fire Thursday at a community college in rural Oregon, killing nine people and wounding seven before he was killed by police, authorities said.completion:The gunman, identified as 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer, was enrolled in the class where the shooting took place, Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin said.Hanlin said it was too early to determine a motive."It's been a terrible day," he said.

(CNN) -- It's at least as welcome as a warm face towel or the ping of the seatbelt sign going off: A beautiful view as you land.||| Airlines are starting to compete more on the quality of their in-flight experiences, from the food and drink they offer to the entertainment options and the way they treat passengers. The focus on the customer experience is being driven by a combination of consumer demand and the need to stand out in an increasingly competitive industry. "Airlines are starting to realize that it's not just about getting you from Point A to Point B," said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst with Hudson Crossing. "It's about creating an experience that will make you want to fly with that airline again." In recent years, airlines have been able to boost their profits by cramming more passengers into planes, but that strategy is starting to wear thin. Airlines are now looking for new ways to increase revenue, and improving the customer experience is one way to do that. "The airlines that are doing well are the ones that are putting the customer first," said Harteveldt. The competition for business travelers is also heating up, as companies increasingly look for ways to cut costs. That has put pressure on airlines to offer better service and more amenities. "Airlines are really starting to focus on the premium traveler," said Harteveldt. "They're realizing that if they can offer a better experience, they can get those travelers to switch airlines." Airlines are also starting to compete more on the basis of price, with some offering lower fares for last-minute bookings. But that could backfire if it leads to an increase in no-shows.

We need more of that in the world.CNN: What do you think is the power of the Etsy community?Chad Dickerson: I think the power of the Etsy community is that it's a global community of artists and artisans. We have 1.7 million sellers from nearly every country in the world, and we have almost 30 million buyers.So the Etsy community is really broad and diverse, and it's full of creative people.

They are the symbols of new beginnings. They remind us of the possibilities of life. When we look at a baby, we are looking at the future.

(CNN) -- One of the most enduring mysteries of the 20th century has been put to rest: DNA analysis of bone fragments has proven that two of Czar Nicholas' children believed to have escaped were killed with their royal family during the Russian Revolution.|||The bones, recovered in 1991 and long thought to belong to Prince Alexei and Princess Maria, were subjected to a DNA analysis that matched them to the DNA of two of the czar's nephews, the Russian Investigative Committee said in a statement Wednesday.

(EW.com ) -- NBC's "The Voice" switched to live shows for the first time this cycle on Monday night, but a chunk of viewers shrugged off the next phase of the hit reality competition series.|||According to preliminary numbers, "The Voice" averaged a 3.8 rating in the 18-49 demographic and 11.8 million viewers. That's down 13% in the demo and 10% in total viewers from last week's performance show, which was pre-taped. "The Voice" was still the night's No. 1 show in both measures, but the demo decline is especially worrisome since "The Voice" is NBC's top-rated series.

This video contains vivid images depicting extremely graphic violence.|||WARNING: This video contains graphic images depicting extremely violent behavior.VICE Reports: Lord of the Flies in AfricaThe first time I ever saw a dead body was in Africa. It was a gruesome, bloody scene -- one that I'll never forget.I was in the Central African Republic, filming a documentary about the Lord's Resistance Army, a brutal rebel group led by the notorious Joseph Kony. The LRA is notorious for its use of child soldiers, and for kidnapping people and turning them into slaves.In the village where I was filming, I came across the body of a young woman who had been brutally murdered. She had been raped, and then hacked to death with a machete.It was a shocking sight, but it was just the beginning.Over the next few days, I saw dozens of dead bodies, all of them brutalized and mutilated. I saw people who had been burned alive, people who had had their eyes gouged out, and people who had been hacked to death with machetes.It was a gruesome, brutal scene, and it left me feeling deeply disturbed.But it was also an important lesson in the reality of war.These days, it's easy to forget that war is a brutal, bloody business. We see photos of soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan wearing helmets and body armor, and we assume that they're safe.But the truth is, war is a dangerous and brutal place, and it can be a very dangerous place for journalists, too.In the Central African Republic, I saw firsthand the brutality of war, and the terrible toll that it can take on human beings. It was a sobering experience, and it left me with a much deeper understanding of the realities of war.
Honolulu (CNN) -- President Barack Obama has now done what every president since Franklin D. Roosevelt has done -- visited the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii.|||The president and first lady Michelle Obama laid a wreath at the memorial Wednesday morning, the 75th anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that killed more than 2,400 Americans.

(CNN) -- In the early days of the Web, the mantra "information wants to be free" made the rounds. In music circles now, "music wants to be shared" seems to be the idea.|||In the past few years, music streaming services such as Spotify and Pandora have become increasingly popular, as people look for ways to listen to their favorite music without having to purchase and store individual songs or albums. In addition, these streaming services allow users to create custom playlists of their favorite songs. In fact, Pandora is based entirely on this idea, as it plays songs based on a "custom station" that the user creates by entering in one or more artist names.

(CNN) -- Wales coach Warren Gatland considered faking an injury to one of his players during Saturday's 9-8 Rugby World Cup semifinal defeat to France, the New Zealand-born coach revealed at a press conference Tuesday.||| "I even thought about faking an injury, but I couldn't work out how I could get someone to lay down on the ground," Gatland said.

Gatland's decision to bring on Liam Williams as a replacement for the injured Scott Williams in the first half was questioned by some pundits, but the coach said he had no regrets.

LONDON, England (CNN) -- A fluffy white polar bear cub that has captured German hearts is making her first public appearance Tuesday at the Nuremberg City Zoo.||| Named after British naturalist David Attenborough, the six-month-old cub is being hand-reared by zoo staff after her mother abandoned her shortly after she was born.

"We're really pleased with her progress," zoo spokeswoman Tanja Munzig said. "She's doing very well." The cub will eventually be moved to a larger enclosure with her mother and father. The zoo is asking the public to help choose a name for the cub. So far, the leading contender is "Noah."

(CNN) -- David Villa came to Spain's rescue again to put the European champions into the World Cup semifinals for the first time with a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Paraguay in Johannesburg on Saturday night as both teams missed a penalty.|||The Barcelona striker, who missed a penalty in the first half, was on hand to fire home the decisive goal from Andres Iniesta's pass in the second period of extra time as Spain recorded their first ever win over Paraguay in World Cup history. Villa's goal ensured Spain will now play Germany in the semifinals in Durban on Wednesday night, while Uruguay and the Netherlands will contest the other semifinal. Diego Forlan and Arjen Robben both missed penalties for their respective sides in a game of few clear-cut chances. Spain, who have now won all six of their games in South Africa, started brightly and should have taken the lead in the sixth minute when Villa was brought down by goalkeeper Justo Villar. However, the 31-year-old Villa, who had converted all six of his penalties for club and country this season, saw his spot-kick brilliantly saved by Villar. Spain continued to dominate possession but found it difficult to create clear-cut chances against a well-drilled Paraguay side, who had come into the game after upsetting Italy in the previous round.
(CNN) -- For a man dubbed "The Big Easy," Ernie Els isn't putting his feet up anytime soon.|||After Els won the British Open in 2002, he didn't win another major championship for nine years. But he has now notched two in the last two years, following his victory at the 2012 U.S. Open. The South African golfer is again in contention at this year's Open, currently in the lead after the first round Thursday. "It feels great," Els said of his current form. "I'm really enjoying it. I'm really blessed that I can still play at this level." The 43-year-old's recent successes are all the more impressive given his health problems in recent years. He was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in 2004, and has had surgery on his elbow, shoulder and knees. "I've had a few operations along the way, and the arthritis is something I have to contend with," Els said. "But I'm managing it well and it doesn't seem to be bothering me on the golf course." He is also a father of two young children, and says he is keen to set a good example for them. "I want to be a good role model for them, and I want them to see that if you work hard, you can achieve anything in life," Els said. "They're my No. 1 fans, and they come to most of my tournaments."
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has blocked the imminent release of dozens of sex offenders who have served their federal sentences after the Obama administration claimed many of them remain "sexually dangerous."||| The Justice Department had asked the court to keep the offenders behind bars as they challenge a lower court's ruling that said the government could not indefinitely detain someone who had completed their sentence. The department argued that it has the authority to detain the offenders -- who were convicted of sex crimes against minors -- on the grounds that they are still a danger to the public. The high court's 5-4 decision Tuesday blocks the release of the offenders while the case is being litigated. Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Stephen Breyer dissented. The case could have broad implications for the more than 5,000 sex offenders who have completed their sentences and are currently being held by the government. The Supreme Court ruled in 2002 that the government could detain sex offenders after they served their sentences if they were deemed to be a danger to the public. The case before the court Tuesday involves offenders who completed their sentences before that ruling.
(CNN) -- Two former World Cup champions have already crashed out of contention for this year's trophy, and a third one will join them on Tuesday.|||Spain and Italy, who between them have won the World Cup four times, will both be eliminated if they lose their matches in Brazil on Tuesday. Spain, the 2010 champions, are taking on Chile in Rio de Janeiro, while Italy, winners in 2006, face Uruguay in Natal. Neither side has ever lost a World Cup match against their Tuesday opponents, but both are under pressure after losing their opening games. Spain, the world's top-ranked team, were humiliated 5-1 by the Netherlands, while Italy were held to a 1-1 draw by England. "We're not going to give up," said Spain captain Iker Casillas. "We have to be positive. We know it's going to be difficult, but we have to fight." Italy coach Cesare Prandelli said his side would have to "do something extraordinary" to win in Uruguay. "We are not happy about the result against England, but we have to look ahead," he said. "We're up against a team that is very strong, both physically and psychologically."

Police said at the time that the death appeared to be an accident, and an autopsy ruled the cause of death as hyperthermia.
(CNN) -- Two of Europe's smaller clubs got lucky on Friday following match-fixing sanctions imposed on Turkish teams.|||Besiktas and Fenerbahce, the two Istanbul-based teams who were found guilty of match-fixing, were both handed reduced bans by UEFA on Friday. Besiktas were given a two-year ban, reduced from the original three-year sentence, while Fenerbahce were given a one-year ban, reduced from the two-year sentence that was originally handed down. The bans apply to European competition only, meaning the two clubs will be able to compete in the Turkish Super Lig and in European competition next season. "The clubs concerned are disqualified from participating in the next UEFA club competition for which they would otherwise qualify in the next three seasons," read a statement on UEFA's website. "This punishment is suspended for a probationary period of five years." The verdicts come following an investigation by UEFA into match-fixing in Turkish football, with 33 people -- including club officials, players and referees -- charged with offenses relating to match-fixing. The case has rocked Turkish football, with the government previously announcing it would investigate the allegations of match-fixing. Turkish Football Federation (TFF) president Yildirim Demiroren also resigned from his post after his son was among those charged. "I thank all of you who have stood by me in this process," Demiroren said in a statement. "I know that I am not alone in this fight. I am a fighter and I will continue this fight until the end."
(CNN) -- A series of U.S. diplomatic cables from early this year directly accused Syria of supplying advanced weaponry, including SCUD ballistic missiles, to the Shiite militia Hezbollah in Lebanon.|||"Syria's ongoing supply of advanced weaponry to Hezbollah continues to concern us," the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon, Jeffrey Feltman, wrote in a February 3, 2010, cable. "We assess that Syria has supplied Hezbollah with Scud missiles and related technology, including technical assistance in the manufacture of Scud-type missiles."The cable, released by WikiLeaks on Monday, also quoted a senior Lebanese security official as saying that Syria had transferred "a few hundred" missiles to Hezbollah."Syria's provision of longer-range missiles to Hezbollah, as well as its transfer of sophisticated weapons to Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist groups, underscore Damascus's long-standing efforts to undermine regional stability," Feltman wrote.The revelation of the Syrian missile transfers to Hezbollah comes as the Obama administration is seeking to increase pressure on the Syrian government over its bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters.
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday she is "praying" that President Bush has a change of heart and does not veto a bipartisan children's health insurance bill that he has labeled an unwarranted expansion of government-run health insurance.|||"I'm praying that the president has a change of heart," Pelosi said at a news conference. "I think it would be a great tragedy if he did veto the bill."Bush has said he will veto the measure, which would expand the State Children's Health Insurance Program by $35 billion over the next five years, because it is an unwarranted expansion of government-run health insurance. The president said the measure duplicates existing programs and does not do enough to crack down on waste, fraud and abuse.Pelosi said she is "extremely confident" that the veto-proof majority in the House will be able to override a veto if it comes to that.
(CNN) -- Call it a political "fumble."|||The Republican National Committee is apologizing for an email that went out to reporters on Tuesday with the subject line "RE: African Americans." The email, which was written in all caps, began "Hi there, reporters." It then listed a series of quotes from black Republican leaders, including former RNC Chairman Michael Steele, about the importance of the GOP's outreach to black voters. The email was sent as reporters gathered in Cleveland for the party's third presidential debate."The RNC congratulates itself for sending out an email with the subject line 'African Americans,' presumably thinking that would win brownie points," said Symone Sanders, spokeswoman for the Bernie Sanders campaign. "The sad reality is that the Republican Party has failed African Americans for decades."The email was quickly denounced as racist."The Republican National Committee's decision to send out an email with the subject line 'African Americans' only underscores how out of touch the party is with the African American community," said LaDavia Drane, director of African American outreach for the Hillary Clinton campaign.RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said the email was "a mistake" and that the committee was "mortified.""We sent out a news release yesterday that was meant to highlight the good news that we have been successful in engaging with African American voters," Priebus said in a statement. "The email was a mistake and we apologize."

(CNN) -- Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair's attempt to spread the festive cheer turned into a turkey after social media users mocked his new Christmas card.|||The card, which Blair posted on his Twitter and Instagram pages on Tuesday, features the politician and his wife Cherie standing in their garden with their three children, Euan, Nicholas and Kathryn. The family are all smiles for the camera, but it was Blair's garish jumper which caught the eye of many social media users.

Blair was branded "tacky" and "a Christmas disaster" for his choice of outfit, with one user describing the card as "the most hideous thing I've ever seen." Another said the former prime minister looked like he was "ready to do some Christmas shopping at Toys 'R' Us."
More than two decades after the death of the systematic racial discrimination policy of apartheid, a community living southeast of South Africa's capital Pretoria is being accused of trying to keep its racist ideals alive.|||The area's mayor has been caught on tape using a derogatory term for black people, and some residents say they want to keep their community "pure" by not allowing people of other races to live there. The community, called Bospoort, lies about an hour and a half southeast of Pretoria. It is made up of about 7,000 residents, all of whom are white. In the recording, obtained by the South African Broadcasting Corporation, the mayor is heard saying, "I don't want blacks in my town. They mustn't come here. Let them go to town." The mayor has denied making the statement, but he has not provided an alternative explanation for why his voice is on the recording.

A recent study by the South African Institute of Race Relations found that, while the overall number of racist incidents in the country is decreasing, there is a "resurgence of racism" in some rural areas.

(CNN) -- So, a judge walks out of a bar ...|||Well, that's not the start of a joke, but the lead-in to a serious story. According to police in Delaware, a municipal court judge was arrested early Saturday morning after she was found walking away from a bar "staggering drunk."

TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iran should be allowed to pursue its nuclear program for peaceful purposes, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday during the first visit to the country by a Kremlin leader since 1943.|||"Iran is our neighbor, just as Russia is Ukraine's neighbor. We should build our relations on the basis of mutual respect and consideration for each other's interests," Putin said in a speech to Iran's parliament, the Islamic Consultative Assembly.Putin's visit is seen as a sign of support for Iran as it negotiates with world powers over its nuclear program.

New York (CNN) -- The defendant's testimony in a stilled Manhattan courtroom Wednesday took a federal jury half a world and many years away, to a mountain cave in the desolation of Afghanistan, to the hours after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks.|||Karen Greenberg, director of the Center on National Security at Fordham Law School, said it was the first time she could remember terrorism being used as a defense in a criminal trial in the United States."It's very unusual. Most terrorism cases are prosecuted as terrorism cases," she said."This is a very novel use of the defense. It will be interesting to see how it plays out."Suleiman Abu Ghaith, 48, took the witness stand in his own defense, telling the jury that he had been summoned to a meeting with Osama bin Laden in a cave in Afghanistan the day after the 9/11 attacks and that the al Qaeda leader had asked him to be a spokesman."I agreed to do so," Abu Ghaith testified.He said he had never met or seen the three defendants on trial with him -- alleged conspirators in the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa that killed 224 people."I didn't know them from Adam," he said.Abu Ghaith testified that he had recorded video and audio messages warning of additional attacks against the United States."It was my intention to scare the American people," he said.The prosecution rested its case on Tuesday after playing for the jury a video in which Abu Ghaith appeared to threaten attacks against the United States.Greenberg said the defense was trying to create reasonable doubt in the minds of the jurors."The defense is saying, 'We're not arguing he's innocent. We're arguing he didn't know what he was doing. He was duped. He was manipulated. He was fooled,'" she said.
(CNN) -- The United Nations official overseeing efforts to help Iraq's many displaced people said Monday the country could be at a turning point.|||"This could be the beginning of the end of the displacement crisis in Iraq," said Lise Grande, the UN's Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq, in a statement.Iraqi forces, with the help of Shi'ite militias and Kurdish peshmerga fighters, have recaptured much of the territory seized by the Islamic State in the summer of 2014.That has led to the displacement of more than three million people, according to the UN."The returns we are seeing are very, very preliminary," Grande said. "People are starting to come back to their homes in small numbers, and this is very encouraging."Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared victory over the Islamic State in December, and Iraqi forces have been moving through the country since then, retaking towns and villages.The UN is preparing for a massive humanitarian response, Grande said, as the displaced people return to their homes."We are talking about hundreds of thousands of people who will need help to restart their lives," she said. "The humanitarian community is up for the challenge, but we need the support of the international community."
(CNN) -- She was found still wearing the shimmering silver cocktail number she wore to celebrate her wedding. She was as bright as the sequins on that dress. Young. Beautiful.||| And dead. Discovered floating in the Hudson River near the George Washington Bridge, the body of 26-year-old Claudine Nemeth was clad in the evening wear she had chosen to mark the beginning of her new life as Mrs. Nemeth. The one-time Miss Hungary had married her American husband, software developer Robert, just three months before her body was fished from the chilly waters of the Hudson. The death of Claudine Nemeth was initially ruled a suicide, but investigators never closed the case. In fact, they opened it up again earlier this year, after Nemeth's family hired a new attorney, John Mancini. Mancini doesn't believe his client committed suicide. And he has a suspect in mind. "There is only one person who could have killed Claudine and that is her husband, Robert Nemeth," Mancini tells CNN. Nemeth, who has always maintained his wife's death was a suicide, was never charged in connection with her death. But Mancini says he is confident that his client will be exonerated and that the real killer will be brought to justice.
(EW.com) -- Most of the muckraking Hollywood movies we think of as classic tend to sketch their dramas inside very clean and satisfying moral lines.|||One example: in "All the President's Men," the journalists are the unambiguous good guys, fighting for the truth against all odds; the establishment (represented by the Nixon White House) is the unambiguous bad guys. Another example: in "The Insider," Lowell Bergman is the crusading journalist trying to do the right thing, while Jeffrey Wigand is the whistleblower who's sacrificed everything to tell the truth; Big Tobacco is the unambiguous bad guys.But with "The Ides of March," director George Clooney and writer Grant Heslov take a far more ambiguous approach to the world of politics. The movie, which stars Ryan Gosling, George Clooney, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Paul Giamatti, is set during the days leading up to the Ohio primary, and it tells the story of a young, idealistic staffer (Gosling) who gets pulled into the orbit of a powerful and ruthless political operative (Clooney). At first, it seems like the movie is going to be a standard-issue political thriller, with unambiguous good guys and bad guys. But as the story progresses, it becomes clear that things are not so simple. The staffers who are working for the idealistic candidate (played by Hoffman) are not necessarily good people, and the candidate himself may not be as pure as he seems. Meanwhile, the political operative who's mentoring Gosling's character is not a simple villain; he's a complex and fascinating character, with his own set of moral codes. The movie is not about good guys versus bad guys; it's about the ambiguities and compromises that are inherent in the world of politics.
(CNN) -- The company building the controversial Keystone XL pipeline has submitted a proposal for a new route, a spokesman for Nebraska's environmental authority said Wednesday.||| The new proposal by TransCanada would avoid the environmentally sensitive Sand Hills region in Nebraska, said Brian McManus, spokesman for the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality. The company will submit its formal application in the next few weeks, he said. The $7 billion Keystone XL pipeline would transport crude oil from Canada to the Texas Gulf Coast. The project has been stalled for more than two years, mainly because of opposition from environmental groups in Nebraska. In January, President Barack Obama rejected the project, saying it would have undercut U.S. efforts to reach a global climate agreement. But he left the door open to a new application if the project's backers could find a new route that avoided the Sand Hills. The proposed new route would still cross the environmentally sensitive Ogallala Aquifer, which supplies water to eight states.
(CNN) -- Frequent flyer programs are meant to breed passenger loyalty. The logic goes that if travelers can earn free tickets and preferential treatment by flying one airline or alliance, they will.

(CNN)In airport surveillance pictures, the three young women look like typical travelers.|||But U.S. authorities say there was nothing typical about the trio. In fact, they were part of an al Qaeda-inspired terror plot to detonate homemade bombs in luggage at two of the busiest airports in the country -- John F.

(CNN) -- He'd said his daddy always told him that a fool never changes his mind. And Elwin Wilson didn't want to be a fool.|||Wilson, a former Ku Klux Klan member, spent the past three decades publicly apologizing for his role in the lynching of a black teenager in South Carolina in 1946.

"It's never too late to do the right thing," Haley said at the time. Wilson is survived by his wife, four children and several grandchildren.
Miami (CNN) -- Hillary Clinton rolled out a new addition to her usual stump speech geared towards women empowerment on Thursday: Her new granddaughter Charlotte.|||"It's hard to believe that only a generation ago, women lacked the right to vote or to own property. It's hard to believe that women were paid less than men for the same work. It's hard to believe that, even today, women are not always treated equally in the workplace or in their homes," Clinton said during a speech in Miami. "But thanks to the hard work of generations of women and men, we've made progress. And I'm proud to stand with all of you as we keep moving forward." Clinton noted that while much progress has been made, "there's still a lot of work to do." She specifically mentioned the need to shatter the "glass ceiling" that keeps women from reaching the highest levels of business and politics.

And I know that there are plenty of qualified women out there who are more than ready to shatter it." Clinton's granddaughter Charlotte was born last week.

But this year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences changed the rules so that only the best picture nominee can be nominated for best director; previously, the directing and best picture nominees could be different. This may mean that the Academy will nominate a different director for best director than the one nominated by the DGA.

The consecration of Gene Robinson as bishop of New Hampshire in 2003 led to a schism in the Anglican Communion. In a statement Friday, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said the Episcopal Church's "approach to sexuality" is "not in line with the majority of our fellow Anglicans." Welby urged the Episcopal Church to "reflect" on its place in the Anglican Communion and said it should no longer take part in decision-making on matters of doctrine and discipline. The Episcopal Church has said it will not back down from its support for gay rights.

(CNN) -- A Pennsylvania judge Friday struck down a law requiring voters in the state to show photo identification at the polls, saying the requirement imposed "unreasonable burden" on voters and represented "a legislative disconnect from reality."||| Judge Robert Simpson said in his ruling that the law, one of the strictest in the nation, could not be enforced for the November election because not enough time remained to educate the public about it. "I am not convinced that the commonwealth has demonstrated that the Photo ID law will not disenfranchise eligible voters," Simpson wrote. The law, passed in March 2012, has been the subject of a heated legal battle. A group of plaintiffs, including the ACLU, had argued that the requirement disenfranchised voters who did not have photo identification, particularly minorities and the elderly. The state had argued that the law was necessary to prevent voter fraud. Judge strikes down Pennsylvania voter ID law. Voter ID laws could disenfranchise millions, study finds.

The United States has also imposed a complete embargo on Syrian oil.

The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers.VICE's latest report takes a look at the city of Amsterdam, Netherlands. The report begins by highlighting the city's rich history, dating back to the 1300s. Amsterdam is also well-known for its liberal attitude, which is on full display in the city's infamous red light district. However, as VICE reporter Ben Anderson points out, the city is in the midst of a major transformation.Many of the city's longtime residents have been priced out of the market, and they are now being replaced by a new wave of wealthy expats. This has led to growing inequality and tensions between the old and new residents of Amsterdam.The report goes on to explore some of the city's other problems, including its struggling economy and high levels of crime. However, Amsterdam still has a lot to offer its residents and visitors, including its beautiful architecture and thriving arts scene.

(CNN) -- The global appeal of football can hardly be doubted. It is said the membership of ruling body FIFA exceeds that of the number of member countries in the United Nations.|||What is in doubt, however, is how much money the sport generates and who gets to share in the riches. A FIFA report seen by Reuters shows that $3.623 billion was generated by the World Cup in Brazil last year, with $2.3 billion going to the organizers, $576 million to FIFA and the rest shared among national associations, clubs and players. That was a rise of almost $500 million on the amount generated by the World Cup in South Africa in 2010. The huge sums generated by the World Cup and other top-level football competitions have long been a source of controversy, with some arguing that too much of the money goes to players and organizers while the vast majority of fans see little or no benefit. There have been protests in Brazil against the huge cost of hosting the World Cup, with demonstrators arguing that the money would have been better spent on hospitals, schools and other public services. Football clubs are also reported to be unhappy with the amount of money they receive from FIFA, with some arguing that they should receive a greater share given the huge profits generated by the sport. FIFA has been under pressure in recent years to make the game more transparent and to share the wealth more equitably.

(CNN) -- A person's risk of stroke is associated with the number of fast-food restaurants near their residence, according to a study presented Thursday at a stroke conference in San Diego, California.|||The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Minnesota, found that people who lived in neighborhoods with a high concentration of fast-food restaurants were more likely to have a stroke than those who lived in neighborhoods with fewer fast-food restaurants.
