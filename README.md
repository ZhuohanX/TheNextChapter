# TheNextChapter

Welcome to **The Next Chapter: A Study of Large Language Models in Storytelling**! This project collects data related to our research, which has been published in [INLG2023](https://inlg2023.github.io/accepted_papers.html).

## Overview

The goal of this project is to explore the potential of large language models in storytelling, examplified by GPT-3. We have conducted extensive comparison and analysis, and you can find the details in our [published paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09790).

## Data Collection

The data collected for this study is organized into two main sections:

### Generated Stories

All the generated stories can be found within the `GeneratedStories` directory. Each text file contains a series of stories, with each line representing a unique pairing of "Condition" and "Story."

### Human Evaluation Results

We have also included the results of the human evaluation in the `HumanEvaluation` directory. These results provide valuable insights into different quality aspects of the generated stories.
